# Monitor app protection policies with Microsoft Intune
You can monitor the compliance status of the app protection policies that you've applied to users. You'll be able to find information about the users affected by the app protection policies, its compliance status, and any issues that your users might be experiencing.

There are three different places to monitor the compliance status:

-   Summary view

-   Detailed view

-   Reporting view

## Summary view

Follow the three steps below to open the Summary view:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and enter your credentials.
2. Choose **More Services**, and type **Intune** in the filter textbox.
3. Choose **Intune App Protection**.

On **Intune mobile application management** blade, you can see a summary of the compliance status:

![Summary tile on the Intune mobile application management blade](../media/mam-azure-portal-user-status-summary.png)

-   **Users**: The total number of users in your company who are using an app which is associated with a policy in a work context.

-   **MANAGED BY POLICY**: The number of users who have used an app who have a policy assigned to them in a work context.

-   **NO POLICY**: The number of users who are using an app that is not targeted by any policy in a work context. You might consider adding these users to the policy.
	> [!NOTE]
	> If you have multiple policies per platform, a user will be considered managed by policy when they have at least one policy assigned to them.

- **Flagged users**: The number of users who are experiencing issues. Currently, only users with jailbroken devices are reported under **Flagged users**.


## Detailed view
You can get to the detailed view of the summary by choosing the **User status** tile (based on device OS platform), and the **Flagged users** tile.

### User status
You can search for a single user and check the compliance status for that user. The **App reporting** blade shows the following information for a selected user:
- Devices that are associated with the user account

- Apps with an app protection policy on the device

- Status:

  - **Checked in**: The policy was deployed to the user, and the app was used in the work context at least once.

  - **Not checked in**: The policy was deployed to the user, but the app has not been used in the work context since then.

>[!NOTE]
> If the users you searched for does not have the app protection policy deployed to them, you'll see a message informing you that the user is not targeted by any app protection policies.

To see the reporting for a user, follow these steps:

1.  To select a user, choose the **Summary** tile.

2. On the **App reporting** blade that opens, choose **Select user** to search for an Azure Active Directory user.

    ![Select user option on the App reporting blade](../media/MAM-reporting-2.png)

3. Select the user from the list. You will see the details of the compliance status for that user.

### Flagged users
The detailed view shows the error message, the app that was accessed when the error happened, the device OS platform affected, and a time stamp.

## Reporting view

You can find the same reports from the Detailed view, and additional reports to help you with the app protection policy compliance status:

-   **App protection user report:** It outlines the same information you can find at the **User status** report under the Detailed view section above.

-   **App protection app report:** It provides two different app protection statuses that admins can select before generating the report. The statuses can be protected or unprotected.

    -   User status for managed MAM activity (Protected): This report outlines the activity of each managed MAM app, on a per user basis.

        -   It shows all apps targeted by app protection policies for each user, and break down the status of each app as checked in with app protection policies, or that was targeted with an app protection policy but the app was never checked in.
<br></br>
    -   User status for unmanaged MAM activity (Unprotected): This report outlines the activity of MAM-enabled apps that are currently unmanaged, on a per user basis. This might happen according to the following reasons:

        -   These apps are either being used by a user or an app that is not currently targeted by an app protection policy.

        -   All apps are checked in, but aren't getting any app protection policies.

## Table grouping

Once the **App protection user report** data shows up, you can aggregate data by the following:

- **Validation result:** The data shows up grouped by app protection status, which can be failure, warning or success.
- **App name:** The data shows up grouped by apps (the actual app name) with failure, warning or success.

## Export app protection activities to CSV

You can export all your app protection policy activities to a single .csv file. This can be helpful to analyze all the app protection statuses reported from the users.

Follow these steps to generate the App protection report:

1. On the Intune mobile application management blade, choose App protection report.

2. Choose Yes to save your report, then choose Save As and select the folder you want to save the report in.
