# Protect email access to Exchange on-premises and legacy Exchange Online Dedicated with Intune

[!INCLUDE [classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

You can configure conditional access control email access to Exchange on-premises or to legacy Exchange Online Dedicated by using Microsoft Intune.
To learn more about how conditional access works, read the [Protect access to email and O365 services](restrict-access-to-email-and-o365-services-with-microsoft-intune.md) article.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an Exchange Online Dedicated environment and need to find out whether it's in the new or the legacy configuration, contact your account manager.

## Before you begin

Make sure to verify the following:

-   Your Exchange version must be **Exchange 2010 or later**. Exchange Server Client Access Server (CAS) arrays are supported.

-   You must use the [Intune on-premises Exchange connector](intune-on-premises-exchange-connector.md), which connects Intune to Exchange on-premises. This lets you manage devices through the Intune console.

    -   The on-premises Exchange connector that is available to you in the Intune console is specific to your Intune tenant and can't be used with any other tenant. We recommend that you also ensure that the Exchange connector for your tenant is installed **on only one machine**.

        You can download the connector from the Intune admin console. For a walkthrough on how to configure the on-premises Exchange connector, see [configure Exchange on-premises connector for on-premises or hosted Exchange](intune-on-premises-exchange-connector.md).

    -   You can install the connector on any machine as long as that machine can communicate with the Exchange server.

    -   The connector supports the **Exchange CAS environment**. You can technically install the connector on the Exchange CAS server directly if you want to. However, we don't recommend it because it increases the load on the server. When you configure the connector, you must set it up to communicate with one of the Exchange CAS servers.

-   You must configure **Exchange ActiveSync** with certificate-based authentication or user credential entry.

### Device compliance requirements

When you configure conditional access policies and target them to a user, before a user can connect to their email, the **device** they use must be:

- Either a domain-joined PC or **enrolled** with Intune.

- **Registered in Azure Active Directory**. Additionally, the client Exchange ActiveSync ID must be registered with Azure Active Directory.

  The Azure Active Directory Device Registration service is activated automatically for Intune and Office 365 customers. Customers who have already deployed the ADFS Device Registration service will not see registered devices in on-premises Active Directory. **This does not apply to Windows PCs and Windows Phone devices**.

- **Compliant** with any Intune compliance policies that are deployed to that device.

### How conditional access works with Exchange on-premises

The following diagram illustrates the flow that conditional access policies for Exchange on-premises use to evaluate whether to allow or block devices.

![Diagram that shows the decision points that determine if a device is allowed access to Exchange on-premises or is blocked](../media/ConditionalAccess8-2.png)

If a conditional access policy isn't met, there is a 10 minute window between the device being blocked and the user receiving one of the following quarantine messages when they sign in:

- If the device isn't enrolled with Intune or isn't registered in Azure Active Directory, a message is displayed with instructions about how to install the Company Portal app, enroll the device, and activate email. This process also associates the device’s Exchange ActiveSync ID with the device record in Azure Active Directory.

-   If the device isn't compliant, a message is displayed that directs the user to the Intune Company Portal website or the Company Portal app, where they can find information about the problem and how to remediate it.

## Support for mobile devices
The following are supported:
-   Windows Phone 8.1 and later.

-   The native email app on iOS.

-   Exchange ActiveSync mail clients, such as Gmail on Android 4 or later.
-   Exchange ActiveSync mail clients on **Android for Work devices**: Only **Gmail** and **Nine Work** apps in the **work profile** are supported on Android for Work devices. For conditional access to work with Android for Work, you must deploy an email profile for the Gmail or Nine Work app, and also deploy those apps as a required installation. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Outlook app for Android and iOS isn't supported.

## Support for PCs
The following is supported:
-   The **Mail** application on Windows 8.1 and later (when the PC is enrolled with Intune).

##  Configure a conditional access policy

1. In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), choose **Policy** > **Conditional Access** > **Exchange on-premises policy**.
   ![IntuneSA5aSelectExchOnPremPolicy](../media/IntuneSA5aSelectExchOnPremPolicy.png)

2. Configure the policy with the settings that you require:
   ![Screenshot of the Exchange on-premises policy page](../media/IntuneSA5bExchangeOnPremPolicy.png)

   - **Block email apps from accessing Exchange on-premises if the device isn't compliant or isn't enrolled with Microsoft Intune**: When you select this option, devices that aren't managed by Intune or aren't compliant with a compliance policy are blocked from accessing Exchange services.

   - **Default rule override - Always allow enrolled and compliant devices to access Exchange**: When you select this option, devices that are enrolled in Intune and are compliant with the compliance policies are allowed to access Exchange.
     This rule overrides the **Default Rule**, which means that even if you set the **Default Rule** to quarantine or block access, enrolled and compliant devices are still able to access Exchange.

   - **Targeted Groups**: Select the Intune user groups that must enroll their device with Intune before they can access Exchange.

   - **Exempted Groups**: Select the Intune user groups that are exempt from the conditional access policy. Users in this list are exempt even if they're also in the **Targeted Groups** list.

   - **Platform Exceptions**: Choose **Add Rule** to configure a rule that defines access levels for specified mobile device families and models. Because these devices can be of any type, you can also configure device types that aren't supported by Intune.

   - **Default Rule**: For a device that isn't covered by any of the other rules, you can choose to allow it to access Exchange, block it, or quarantine it. When you set the rule to allow access, for devices that are enrolled and compliant, email access is granted automatically for iOS, Windows, and Samsung KNOX devices. The user doesn't have to go through any process to get their email.
     - On Android devices that don't run Samsung KNOX, users get a quarantine email, which includes a guided walkthrough to verify enrollment and compliance before they can access email. If you set the rule to block access or quarantine devices, all devices are blocked from getting access to Exchange, regardless of whether they're already enrolled in Intune or not. To prevent enrolled and compliant devices from being affected by this rule, check the **Default Rule Override** box.
       >[!TIP]
       >If your intention is to first block all devices before granting access to email, choose the Block access rule or the Quarantine rule. The default rule applies to all device types—so device types that you configure as platform exceptions that aren't supported by Intune are also affected.

   - **User Notification**: In addition to the notification email that Exchange sends, Intune sends an email that contains steps to unblock the device. You can edit the default message to customize it to your needs. In the event that the user’s device is blocked before they receive the Intune notification email that contains remediation instructions (this email is delivered to the user’s Exchange mailbox), they can use an unblocked device or another method to access Exchange and view the message.
     - This is especially true when the **Default Rule** is set to block or quarantine. In this case, the user has to go to their app store, download the Microsoft Company Portal app, and enroll their device. This is applicable to iOS, Windows, and Samsung KNOX devices. For devices that don't run Samsung KNOX, you need to send the quarantine email to an alternate email account. The user has to copy the email to their blocked device to complete the enrollment and compliance process.
       > [!NOTE]
       > In order for Exchange to be able to send the notification email, you must specify the account that is used to send the notification email.
       >
       > For details, see [Configure Exchange on-premises connector for on-premises or hosted Exchange](intune-on-premises-exchange-connector.md).

3. When you're done, choose **Save**.

-   You don't have to deploy the conditional access policy—it takes effect immediately.

-   After a user sets up an Exchange ActiveSync profile, it might take from one to three hours for the device to be blocked (if it isn't managed by Intune).

-   If a blocked user then enrolls the device with Intune and remediates noncompliance, email access will be unblocked within two minutes.

-   If the user unenrolls from Intune, it might take from one to three hours for the device to be blocked.
