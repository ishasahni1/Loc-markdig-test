# Enable Lookout MTD connection in the Intune classic portal

[!INCLUDE [classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

To enable the Lookout Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) connection in Intune, you should have already configured the Intune Connector in the Lookout console.  If you have not already done so, you should [Set up your Lookout Mobile Threat Defense subscription](setup-your-lookout-mtd-subscription.md).

To enable the Lookout MTP connection in Intune, on the **Administration** page in the [Microsoft Intune administrator console](https://manage.microsoft.com), choose **Third Party Service Integration**. Choose **Lookout status** and enable **Synchronization with MTP** using the toggle button.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> You **must** configure the Lookout for Work app before creating compliance policy rules and configuring conditional access. This ensures that the app is ready and available for end users to install before they can get access to email or other company resources.

This completes the setup of the Lookout and Intune integration in the Intune administrator console.  The next few steps to implement this solution involve deploying the [Lookout for Work apps](/intune-classic/deploy-use/device-threat-protection-policy) policy.
