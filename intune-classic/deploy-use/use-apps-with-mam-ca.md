# What to expect when using an app with app-based CA

[!INCLUDE[classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

App-based CA verifies the identity of the approved application by means of a broker app that must be present on the device:
*  On **iOS**, the **Azure Authenticator app** is the broker app.
* On **Android**, the **Intune Company Portal app** is the broker app. 

End-users signing in for the first time, to an app that is supported by app-based CA, like OneDrive or Outlook, are prompted to install the broker app and register the device with Azure AD. Device registration in Azure AD (previously known as Workplace Join) will create a device record and certificate against which tokens are issued.  This is **not** the same as **MDM enrollment**. There are no management profiles or policies that are applied, and there is no inventory taken of apps on the device.  The process of installing the broker app and registering the device will only happen on the first use of a managed app.

The following is a list of properties that are directly derived from the device:

* alternativeSecurityIds (Azure Active Directory Certificate thumbprint and public key hash)
* deviceOSType
* deviceOSVersion
* displayName

> [!NOTE]
> On Android devices:
  * It is required that the Company Portal app is installed on the device, but end-user is not required to log in into app.
  * Device registration must be done through the OneDrive or Outlook app.

## To remove a device from Azure AD registration.
You can remove the device registration either through the Azure AD admin console which is typically done by the IT admin.  It can also be done by the end-user on the device itself.

* **Azure AD admin console**: In the Azure AD admin console**, delete the device that you want to remove.
* **iOS device**: Open the Azure Authenticator app, swipe left on the account, and choose unregister.  
* **Android device**: Uninstall the company portal app or remove the account from the **System settings**.

## App-based CA with Device-based CA  

You can configure [Conditional access based on device compliance](restrict-access-to-email-and-o365-services-with-microsoft-intune.md) (**Device CA**) on the [Intune administrator console](https://manage.microsoft.com) or the [Azure AD Premium management console] (https://manage.windowsazure.com). Device CA require users to connect to Exchange Online only through Intune-managed  devices that are compliant with the Intune device compliance policy or domain-joined PCs.  If a user belongs to one or more security groups that are targeted for both app-based CA and Device CA policies, the user must meet one of the two requirements:
* The app used to access the service is a mobile app that is supported by 
* , and the device that the app is running on, has **iOS Authenticator (for iOS devices)**, or the **Company Portal app (for Android devices)** installed.
* The device used to access the service is **Intune-managed and compliant** with the Intune device compliance policy, or it is a **domain-joined PC**.  Here are some examples to help illustrate this:
  * If a user tries to connect from the **native iOS email app**, he or she will be required to be on a **managed and compliant device** since the native mail app is not supported by app-based CA.
  * If a user tries to connect from a **Windows home PC**, the **Device CA policy** will apply, requiring that the he or she must use a domain-joined PC.
