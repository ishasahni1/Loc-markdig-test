# Create Lookout device compliance policy in Intune

[!INCLUDE[classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

Intune with Lookout Mobile Threat Defense lets you detect threats on mobile devices and assess risk on those devices. You can create a compliance policy rule that assesses risk to determine if the device is compliant. You can then use conditional access policy to block access to services based on device compliance.

Prerequisites for compliance policy with Lookout Mobile Threat Defense:

- [Set up Lookout Mobile Threat Defense subscription](setup-your-lookout-mtd-subscription.md)
- [Enable the Lookout connection in Intune](enable-lookout-mtd-connection.md)
- [Configure and deploy the Lookout for work app](configure-deploy-lookout-for-work-app.md)

As part of the Lookout Mobile Threat Defense setup, in the [Lookout console](https://aad.lookout.com), you created a policy that classifies various threats as high, medium and low. In the Intune compliance policy, you set the maximum allowed threat level.

1. In the [Intune administrator console](https://manage.microsoft.com), go to the **Compliance Policies** page. You can either use an existing compliance policy or create a new one. Go to **Device Health** and enable **Device Threat Protection**.

2. Select the **Maximum allowed threat level**:
   * **None (Secured)**: This is the most secure.  The device cannot have any threats present and still access company resources.  If any threats are found, the device is evaluated as non-compliant.  
   * **Low**: The device is compliant if only low level threats are present. Anything higher puts the device in a non-compliant status.
   * **Medium**: The device is compliant if the threats found on the device are low or medium level. If high level threats are detected, the device is determined as non-compliant.
   * **High**: This is the least secure. This allows all threat levels, and uses Lookout mobile threat protection for reporting purposes only.

If you create conditional access policies for Office 365 or other services, this compliance evaluation is assessed and non-compliant devices are blocked from accessing those services until the threat is resolved.

## Monitor device threats
To see the compliance state of a device, go to the [Intune administrator console](https://manage.microsoft.com) and view **All Devices**.
