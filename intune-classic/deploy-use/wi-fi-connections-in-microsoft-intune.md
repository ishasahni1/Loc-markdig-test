# Configure devices to connect to your corporate Wi-Fi networks

[!INCLUDE [classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

Use Microsoft Intune Wi-Fi profiles to deploy wireless network settings to users and devices in your organization. When you deploy a Wi-Fi profile, your users have access to your corporate Wi-Fi without having to configure it themselves.

For example, you install a new Wi-Fi network named **Contoso Wi-Fi** and want to set up all iOS devices to connect to this network. Here's the process:

![Wi-Fi profile process summary](..\media\wi-fi-process-diagram.png)

1.   Create a Wi-Fi profile that contains the settings that are necessary to connect to the **Contoso Wi-Fi** wireless network.

2.   Deploy the profile to the group of users with iOS devices.

3.   Users find the new **Contoso Wi-Fi** network in the list of wireless networks and can easily connect to this network.


## Create a Wi-Fi profile

You can deploy Wi-Fi profiles to the following platforms:

-   Android 4.0 and later

-   Android for Work   

-   iOS 8.0 and later

-   Mac OS X 10.9 and later

For devices that run Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 desktop or mobile operating systems, you can import a Wi-Fi configuration profile that was previously exported to a file. For details, see [Export or import a Wi-Fi configuration profile for Windows devices](#export-or-import-a-wi-fi-configuration-profile-for-windows-devices).

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), choose **Policy** &gt; **Add Policy**.

2.  Select one of the following policy types, and then choose **Create Policy**:

    -   Wi-Fi Profile (Android 4 and later)

    -   Wi-Fi Profile (Android for Work)

    -   Wi-Fi Profile (iOS 8.0 and later)

    -   Wi-Fi Profile (Mac OS X 10.9 and later)


There are no recommended settings for this policy type. You must create a custom policy.

3. Provide the name and description for the profile.

4. Specify the **Network Connections** values.
   - **SSID (Service Set Identifier)**: Select this option if you want users to see the network name and not the SSID.
   - **Connect when the network is not broadcasting its name (SSID)**: Select this option to enable devices to connect to the network when it is not visible in the list of networks (because it is hidden and not broadcasting its name).

5. Configure the **Security Settings** for the selected platform. The available settings depend on the security types you select. They are described in [Security settings](#security-settings).

6. Configure **Proxy Settings** (iOS and MAC OS X only).

7. Save the Wi-Fi profile

The new policy is displayed in the **Configuration Policies** node of the **Policy** workspace. See **Next steps** for information about deploying the profile.

## Export or import a Wi-Fi configuration profile for Windows devices

For devices that run Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 desktop or mobile operating systems, you can import a Wi-Fi configuration profile that was previously exported to a file.

### Export a Wi-Fi profile
In Windows, you can use the **netsh wlan** utility to export an existing Wi-Fi profile to an XML file that's readable by Intune. On a Windows computer that already has the required Wi-Fi profile installed, here are the steps to take:

1.  Create a local folder for the exported Wi-Fi- profiles. For example, create a folder called **c:\WiFi.**

2.  Open a command prompt as an administrator.

3.  Run the command `netsh wlan show profiles`, and note the name of the profile you'd like to export.  In this example, the profile name is **WiFiName**.

4.  Run this command: `netsh wlan export profile name="ProfileName" folder=c:\Wifi`.This creates a Wi-Fi profile file named **Wi-Fi-WiFiName.xml** in your target folder.

### Import a Wi-Fi profile
Use the **Windows Wi-Fi Import Policy** to import a set of Wi-Fi settings that you can then deploy to the required user or device groups.


1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Policy** &gt; **Add Policy**.

2.  Configure a policy of the type **Windows** &gt; **Wi-Fi Import (Windows 8.1 and later)**.

    This policy can be applied to devices that run Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 desktop and mobile operating systems.

    You can only create and deploy a *custom* Windows Wi-Fi import policy. Recommended settings are not available.

3.  Specify the following general values for the Windows Wi-Fi Import Policy:

    |Setting name|More information|
    |----------------|--------------------|
    |**Name**|Enter a unique name for the Wi-Fi profile to identify it in the Intune console.|
    |**Description**|Provide a description of the Wi-Fi profile and other relevant information that helps you locate it.|

4.  Specify the following values under the **Custom Wi-Fi Profile** heading:

    |Setting name|More information|
    |----------------|--------------------|
    |**Configuration profile file**|Choose **Import** to select the XML file that contains the Wi-Fi profile settings that you want to import into Intune.|
    |**Custom configuration profile name (displayed to users)**|Choose how to display the name of the Wi-Fi configuration profile as it will be shown to users on their device.|
    |**Configuration profile details**|Choose how to display the XML code for the configuration profile that you selected.|

5.  When you're finished, choose **Save Policy**.

6.  The new policy displays in the **Configuration Policies** node of the **Policy** workspace.

## Deploy the profile

Because a profile is a type of policy, you use the **Policy** workspace to deploy it.

1.  In the **Policy** workspace, select the policy you want to deploy, then choose **Manage Deployment**.

2.  In the **Manage Deployment** dialog box:

    -   **To deploy the policy**: Select one or more groups to which you want to deploy the policy. Then choose  **Add** &gt; **OK**.

    -   **To close the dialog box without deploying it**: Click **Cancel**.


The **Overview** page of the **Policy** workspace displays issues with the policy that require your attention. Additionally, a status summary appears in the Dashboard workspace.

## Security settings
These tables have the details for the security settings that are available for Android, iOS, and Mac OS X Wi-Fi profiles.
