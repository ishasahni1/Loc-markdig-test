# Deploy and monitor a device compliance policy in Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

## Deploy a compliance policy
Deploy the compliance policy that you [created](create-a-device-compliance-policy-in-microsoft-intune.md) to one or more groups of users in your organization. When a compliance policy is deployed to a user, the user's devices are checked for compliance.

1.  In the **Policy** workspace, select the policy you want to deploy, and then choose **Manage Deployment**.

2.  In the **Manage Deployment** dialog box, choose one or more groups to which you want to deploy the policy, and then choose **Add** > **OK**.

Use Active Directory groups that you have already created and synced to Intune, or create these groups manually in the Intune console. To learn more about how to deploy policies, see [Deploy a configuration policy](manage-settings-and-features-on-your-devices-with-microsoft-intune-policies.md).

Use the status summary and alerts on the **Overview** page of the **Policy** workspace to identify problems with the policy that need your attention. Additionally, a status summary appears in the **Dashboard** workspace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have not deployed a compliance policy and you enable an Exchange conditional access policy, all targeted devices will have access.

## Monitor the compliance policy

#### To view devices that do not conform to a compliance policy

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), choose **Groups** > **All Devices**.

2.  Double-click the name of a device in the list of devices.

3.  Choose the **Policy** tab to see a list of the policies for that device.

4.  From the **Filters** drop-down list, choose **Does not conform to compliance policy**.

#### To view the health attestation reports

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), choose **Reports**.

2.  On the **Health Attestation Report - Create a new report** page, you can view a report with all the Windows 10 health attestation data that Intune has collected. You can also create a report with a subset of the data by using filters. The filters can be based on the type of device, the operating system, or only a subset of data points.

## How Intune resolves policy conflicts
Policy conflicts can occur when multiple Intune policies are applied to a device. If the policy settings overlap, Intune resolves any conflicts by using the following rules:

-   If the conflicting settings are from an Intune configuration policy and a compliance policy, the settings in the compliance policy take precedence over the settings in the configuration policy. This happens even if the settings in the configuration policy are more secure.

-   If you have deployed multiple compliance policies, Intune will use the most secure of these policies.

## Next steps
