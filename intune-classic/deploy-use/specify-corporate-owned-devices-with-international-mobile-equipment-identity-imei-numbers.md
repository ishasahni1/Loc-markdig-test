# Specify corporate-owned devices with international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) numbers

[!INCLUDE [classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

Microsoft Intune lets admins import international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) numbers for mobile device platforms by using IMEI numbers to help identify corporate-owned mobile devices. After devices are enrolled in Intune, you can see devices that have imported IMEI numbers under **Groups** > **Overview** > **All Devices**. **Device group** lists devices that have imported IMEI numbers as **Corporate** in the **Ownership** column.

1. In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), choose **Groups** &gt; **All Devices** &gt; **All Corporate Pre-enrolled Devices** &gt; **By IMEI (All platforms)**, and then choose **Add devices…**. You can add devices in two ways:

   - **Upload a .csv file that has serial numbers** – Create a two-column, comma-separated value (.csv) list without a header, and limit the list to 5,000 devices or 5 MB per .csv file. The details field is limited to 128 characters. 


     |                 |                           |
     |-----------------|---------------------------|
     | &lt;IMEI #1&gt; | &lt;Device #1 Details&gt; |
     | &lt;IMEI #2&gt; | &lt;Device #2 Details&gt; |

     This .csv file when viewed in a text editor appears as:

     ```
     01234567890123,device details
     02234567890123,device details
     ```

   - **Manually add device details** - Enter the IMEI number and device details of up to 15 devices.

   The *Details* field is for administrative use. You can specify details to help identify the device in the list of Corporate-owned devices listed by hardware ID. This information is not sent to the device, but it will appear in the Intune console.

2. Choose **Next**.
3. On the **Review Devices** pane, you can confirm the imported device IMEI numbers. You can also decide whether to overwrite the **Details** for IMEI numbers that are being imported again. You can uncheck the **Overwrite** box to preserve the Current details. Choose **Finish** to import the IMEI numbers.
4. The imported IMEI numbers and descriptions are added to the **By IMEI (All platforms)** list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are importing IMEI numbers for Android devices, be aware that some Android devices can have multiple IMEI numbers. If you import an IMEI number but it is not the IMEI reported to Intune by the device, the device will be classifed as a personal device instead of a company-owned device.

When a device that has IMEI number enrolls in Intune, usually when a user installs the Company Portal app and completes the enrollment process, the device will be tagged as corporate-owned and appear as enrolled in the **IMEI Devices** group.

>[!NOTE]
> When your organization is migrated to the new Azure portal in the near future, you will see a change to this feature. In the existing Intune administrator console, admins can accept associated details from an uploaded CSV and overwrite the existing details for individual hardware identifiers. In the new Azure portal, you’ll be able to automatically overwrite the details for all hardware identifiers or to ignore all new details for existing identifiers.
