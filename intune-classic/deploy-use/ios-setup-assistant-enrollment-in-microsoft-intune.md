# Enroll iOS devices with Apple Configurator by using Setup Assistant

[!INCLUDE[classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

Intune supports the enrollment of corporate-owned iOS devices using [Apple Configurator](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=518017) running on a Mac computer. This process resets the device to factory settings and prepares it to run Setup Assistant, installing the company's policies for the device’s new user.

>[!NOTE]
>This enrollment method can't be used with the [device enrollment manager](enroll-corporate-owned-devices-with-the-device-enrollment-manager-in-microsoft-intune.md) method.

Using Apple Configurator, you can reset an iOS device to factory settings and prepare it to be set up for the device’s new user. This method requires you to connect the iOS device to a Mac computer via USB to set up corporate enrollment, and it assumes you are using Apple Configurator 2.0. Most scenarios require that the policy applied to the iOS device include **user affinity** to enable the Intune Company Portal app.

## Prerequisites for enrolling iOS devices by using Apple Configurator with Setup Assistant

- [Install an APNs certificate](set-up-ios-and-mac-management-with-microsoft-intune.md)

- Ensure that you have physical access to iOS devices&mdash;devices must be reset to factory settings without password protection

- Get device serial numbers&mdash;see [How to get an iOS serial number](https://support.apple.com/HT204308)

- Have USB connection cables on hand

- Have a Mac computer with [Apple Configurator 2.0](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator-2/id1037126344?mt=12)


## Steps to enroll iOS devices by using Apple Configurator with Setup Assistant

The following steps explain how to enroll iOS devices on "day 0" by using Apple Configurator with Setup Assistant. As devices are added and removed from your organization, you will likely repeat some of these steps, such as adding or removing serial numbers, as described below.

### Create mobile device groups (optional)

If your business requires mobile device groups to help manage devices, you can optionally create those groups. To learn more, see [Use groups to manage users and devices with Microsoft Intune](use-groups-to-manage-users-and-devices-with-microsoft-intune.md).

### Create a profile for devices

A device enrollment profile defines the settings applied to a group of devices.

1. In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), go to **Policy** &gt; **Corporate Device Enrollment**, and then choose **Add**.

  ![Create device enrollment profile](../media/pol-sa-corp-enroll.png)

2. Enter details for the device profiles:

   -   **Name**&mdash;The name of the device enrollment profile (not visible to users).

   -   **Description**&mdash;A description of the device enrollment profile (not visible to users).

   -   **Enrollment Details**&mdash;Specifies how devices are enrolled.

       -   **Prompt for user affinity**&mdash;The device must be affiliated with a user during initial setup and can then be permitted to access company data and email. **User affinity** should be set up for managed devices that belong to users and need to use the company portal for services like installing apps.

       -   **No user affinity**&mdash;The device is not affiliated with a user. Use this affiliation for devices that perform tasks without accessing local user data. Apps requiring user affiliation (including the Company Portal app used for installing line-of-business apps) won’t work.

   -   **Device group pre-assignment**&mdash;All devices deployed with this profile will initially belong to this group. You can reassign devices after enrollment.

   > [!Important]
   > Group assignments are moving from Intune to Azure Active Directory. Once your Intune account receives the applicable update, you won't see the **Assign devices to the following group** option. [Learn more](/intune-classic/deploy-use/ios-device-enrollment-program-in-microsoft-intune#changes-to-intune-group-assignments).

   -  **Device Enrollment Program**&mdash;The Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP) cannot be used with Setup Assistant enrollment. Ensure that the toggle is set to **off**.

3.  Choose **Save Profile** to add the profile.

### Add iOS devices to enroll with Setup Assistant

1. In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), go to **Groups** &gt; **All Devices** &gt; **All Corporate-owned Devices** &gt; **All Devices**, and then choose **Add devices**.

   You can add devices in two ways:

   ![Add devices dialog box](../media/pol-SA-enroll-iOS-SetupAssistant.png)

   -  **Upload a CSV file containing serial numbers**&mdash;Create a comma-separated value (.csv) list of two columns without a header, limited to 5,000 devices or 5 MB per .csv file.

    |||
    |-|-|
    |&lt;Serial #1&gt;|&lt;Device #1 Details&gt;|
    |&lt;Serial#2&gt;|&lt;Device #2 Details&gt;|

  When viewed in a text editor, this .csv file appears as:

    ```
    0000000,PO 1234
    111111111,PO 1234
    ```

  -  **Manually add device details**&mdash;Enter the serial number and any notes or details for up to 15 devices.

  On the **Review Devices** pane, you can confirm the serial numbers. You can also decide whether to overwrite the **Details** for serial numbers that are being imported again, or you can uncheck the **Overwrite** box to preserve the Current details.

  > [!NOTE]
  > In the existing Intune administrator console, admins can accept associated details from an uploaded CSV and overwrite the existing details for individual serial numbers. In the new Azure portal, you’ll only be able to overwrite the details for all serial numbers or to ignore new details for all serial numbers.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you want to remove corporate-owned devices from Intune management later, you might need to go to **By iOS Serial Number** device group under **Corporate Pre-enrolled devices** and remove the device serial number from Intune in order to disable device enrollment. If Intune performs a disaster recovery procedure on or around the time you remove serial numbers, you'll need to verify that only active devices’ serial numbers are present in that group.

2. Choose **Next**.

3. Select the devices to enroll. Serial numbers already enrolled or enrolled by other means cannot be imported. Choose **Next** to continue.

### Assign a profile

Specify the profile to assign to added devices from the list of available profiles, review the **Enrollment profile details**, and then choose **Finish**. Manually added devices can be assigned to any enrollment profile.

> [!Important]
> Currently, Intune let you designate a "default" device enrollment profile," which means that new serial numbers are automatically assigned to that default profile when you synchronize new serial numbers with the Apple service. When your tenant is migrated to the new Azure portal in the near future, you will no longer be able to set a default profile and have serial numbers be automatically assigned to that profile. Instead, you will have to assign serial numbers to a profile. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios)

### Export a profile to deploy to iOS devices

1. In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), go to **Policy** &gt; **Corporate Device Enrollment**, and then select the device profile to deploy to mobile devices.

2. Choose **Export** in the taskbar. Copy and save the **Profile URL**. You will upload it in Apple Configurator later to define the Intune profile used by iOS devices.

   You will upload this profile URL to the Apple service using Apple Configurator in the following procedure to define the Intune profile used by iOS devices.

### Prepare the device with Apple Configurator

iOS devices are connected to the Mac computer and enrolled for mobile device management.

1.  On a Mac computer, open **Apple Configurator 2**. In the menu bar, choose **Apple Configurator 2**, and then choose **Preferences**.

   > [!WARNING]
   > The devices will be reset to factory configurations during the enrollment process. As a best practice, reset the device and turn it on. Devices should be at the **Hello** screen when you connect the device.

2. In the preferences pane, select **Servers** and choose the plus symbol (+) to launch the MDM Server wizard. Choose **Next**.

3. Enter the **Hostname or URL** and **enrollment URL** for the MDM server under Setup Assistant enrollment for iOS devices with Microsoft Intune. For the Enrollment URL, enter the enrollment profile URL exported from Intune. Choose **Next**.  

   You can safely disregard a warning stating "server URL is not verified." To continue, choose **Next** until the wizard is finished.

4.  Connect the iOS mobile devices to the Mac computer with a USB adapter.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The devices will be reset to factory configurations during the enrollment process. As a best practice, reset the device and turn it on. Devices should be at the **Hello** screen when you start Setup Assistant.

5.  Choose **Prepare**. On the Prepare iOS Device pane, select **Manual** and then choose **Next**.

6. On the Enroll in MDM Server pane, select the server name you created, and then choose **Next**.

7. On the Supervise Devices pane, select the level of supervision, and then choose **Next**.

8. On the Create an Organization pane, choose the **Organization** or create a new organization, and then choose **Next**.

9. On the Configure iOS Setup Assistant pane, choose the steps to be presented to the user, and then choose **Prepare**. If prompted, authenticate to update trust settings.  

10. When the iOS device finishes preparing, disconnect the USB cable.  

### Distribute devices

The devices are now ready for corporate enrollment. Turn off the devices and distribute them to users. When users turn on their devices, Setup Assistant will start.
