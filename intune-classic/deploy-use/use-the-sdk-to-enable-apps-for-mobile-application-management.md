# Use the SDK to enable apps for mobile application management

[!INCLUDE [classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

Use the Microsoft Intune App SDK to let Intune manage certain features of your iOS or Android apps. After your app is enabled, you can deploy policies to the app. These policies use those features to help protect your corporate data. Examples of the types of protections that you can implement with the SDK are:

-   Prevent users from copying corporate documents to the cloud.

-   Require encryption of data that the app saves to the device.

-   Enforce the use of a managed browser.

-   Remotely wipe corporate data from the app.

You need access to the app's source code to use the SDK, but you can enable most of the SDK features without having to change the app's behavior.

For an overview of the SDK, see the [Overview](/intune/app-sdk-get-started).
