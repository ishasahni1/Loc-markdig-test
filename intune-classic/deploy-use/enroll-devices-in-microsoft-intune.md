# Enroll devices for management in Intune

[!INCLUDE[classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

You can enroll devices, including Windows PCs, to enable mobile device management (MDM) with Microsoft Intune. This topic describes different ways to enroll mobile devices in Intune management. The way you enroll your devices depends on the device type, ownership, and the level of management that's needed. "Bring your own device" (BYOD) enrollment lets users enroll their personal phones, tablets, or PCs. Corporate-owned device (COD) enrollment enables management scenarios like automatic enrollment, shared devices, or pre-authorized enrollment requirements.

If you use [Exchange ActiveSync](#mobile-device-management-with-exchange-activesync-and-intune), either on-premises or hosted in the cloud, you can enable simple Intune management without enrollment. Windows PCs can also be managed using [Intune client software](#windows-pc-management-with-intune).

By default, devices for all platforms are allowed to enroll in Intune. To block devices from enrolling, sign to the [Microsoft Intune admin portal](https://manage.microsoft.com) with your admin credentials. Choose **Admin** > **Mobile Device Management** > **Enrollment Rules** and then clear the applicable check boxes for the platforms that you want to block.

## Overview of device enrollment methods

The following table shows Intune enrollment methods and the supported capabilities and requirements of each method. The capabilities and requirements are described below.

- **Wipe** - Indicates whether the device needs to be wiped before users can enroll the device. The term "wipe" means a factory reset of the device, which removes all data. For more information, see [Retire devices](retire-devices-from-microsoft-intune-management.md).
- **Affinity** - Associates devices with users. Required for mobile application management (MAM) and conditional access to company data. For more information, see [User affinity](enroll-corporate-owned-ios-devices-in-microsoft-intune.md#use-the-company-portal-on-dep-enrolled-or-apple-configurator-enrolled-devices).
- **Lock** - Indicates if users are prevented from unenrolling their devices using native operating system menus. Users can unenroll their devices on all platforms by using their Company Portal app.

For a series of questions that help you find the right method, see [Choose how to enroll devices](/intune-classic/get-started/choose-how-to-enroll-devices1).

## BYOD
"Bring your own device" users install the Company Portal app and enroll their device. This enables users to connect to the company network and join the domain or Azure Active Directory. For most platforms, you have to enable BYOD enrollment for many COD scenarios. For more information, see [Prerequisites for device enrollment](prerequisites-for-enrollment.md). ([Go back to the table](#overview-of-device-enrollment-methods))

## Corporate-owned devices
Corporate-owned devices (COD) can be managed by using the Intune console. iOS devices can be enrolled directly through the tools that are provided by Apple. All device types can be enrolled by an admin or manager using the device enrollment manager. Devices with an IMEI number can also be identified and tagged as company-owned to enable COD scenarios.

For more information, see [Enroll corporate-owned devices](manage-corporate-owned-devices.md).

### DEM
Device enrollment manager is a special Intune account that's used to enroll and manage multiple corporate-owned devices. Managers can install the Company Portal and enroll many user-less devices. Learn more about [DEM](enroll-corporate-owned-devices-with-the-device-enrollment-manager-in-microsoft-intune.md). ([Go back to the table](#overview-of-device-enrollment-methods))

### DEP
Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP) management lets you create and deploy policy “over the air” to iOS devices that are purchased and managed with DEP. The device is enrolled when users turn on the device for the first time and run iOS Setup Assistant. This method supports **iOS Supervised** mode, which in turn enables:
  -	Locked enrollment
  -	Kiosk mode and other advanced configurations and restrictions

Learn more about [DEP](ios-device-enrollment-program-in-microsoft-intune.md). ([Go back to the table](#overview-of-device-enrollment-methods))

### USB-SA
IT admins use Apple Configurator, via USB, to prepare each corporate-owned device manually for enrollment using Setup Assistant. The IT admin creates an enrollment profile and exports it to Apple Configurator. When users receive their devices, they are then prompted to run Setup Assistant to enroll their device. This method supports **iOS Supervised** mode, which in turn enables:
  -	Locked enrollment
  -	Kiosk mode and other advanced configurations and restrictions

Learn more about [Setup Assistant enrollment with Apple Configurator](ios-setup-assistant-enrollment-in-microsoft-intune.md). ([Go back to the table](#overview-of-device-enrollment-methods))

### USB-Direct
For direct enrollment, the admin must enroll each device manually by creating an enrollment policy and exporting it to Apple Configurator. USB-connected, corporate-owned devices are enrolled directly and don't require a factory reset. Devices are managed as user-less devices. They are not locked or supervised and cannot support conditional access, jailbreak detection, or mobile application management.  Learn more about [direct enrollment with Apple Configurator](ios-direct-enrollment-in-microsoft-intune.md). ([Go back to the table](#overview-of-device-enrollment-methods))

## Mobile device management with Exchange ActiveSync and Intune
Mobile devices that aren't enrolled but that connect to Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) can be managed by Intune using EAS MDM policy. Intune uses an Exchange Connector to communicate with EAS, either on-premises or cloud-hosted. For more information, see [Mobile device management with Exchange ActiveSync and Intune](mobile-device-management-with-exchange-activesync-and-microsoft-intune.md).


## Windows PC management with Intune  
You can also use Microsoft Intune to manage Windows PCs with the Intune client software. PCs that are managed with the Intune client can:

 - Report software and hardware inventories
 - Install desktop applications (for example .exe and .msi files)
 - Manage firewall settings

PCs that are managed with the Intune client software cannot be fully wiped, although selective wipe is available. PCs managed with the Intune software client cannot take advantage of many Intune management features such as conditional access, VPN and Wi-Fi settings, or deployment of certificates and email configurations. For more information, see [Manage Windows PCs with Intune](manage-windows-pcs-with-microsoft-intune.md).

## Supported device platforms

Intune can manage the following device platforms:
