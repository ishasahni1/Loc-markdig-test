# Intune policy settings for Windows 10 devices in Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

This topic contains information to help you to understand the Intune policy settings that you can use to manage Windows 10 devices. Read this topic alongside the procedures in [Manage settings and features on your-devices with Microsoft Intune policies](/intune-classic/get-started/windows-pc-management-capabilities-in-microsoft-intune).

You can choose from two policy types:

- **Custom policy**: Use the Microsoft Intune **custom policy** for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile to deploy OMA-URI (Open Mobile Alliance Uniform Resource Identifier) settings that can be used to control features on devices. Windows 10 makes many CSP settings available, for example, the [Policy Configuration Service Provider (Policy CSP)](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/manage/how-it-pros-can-use-configuration-service-providers).
- **General configuration policy**: Use this policy type when you want to select settings from the built-in list that's supplied with Microsoft Intune.

## Custom policy settings

Supply the following settings in a custom policy.

### General settings

Enter a name and an optional description for this policy to help you identify it in the Intune console.

### OMA-URI settings

For each OMA-URI setting you want to add, enter the following information:

- **Setting name**: Enter a unique name for the OMA-URI setting to help you identify it in the list of settings. You can find more information about URI settings at [Policy Configuration Service Provider (Policy CSP)](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/manage/how-it-pros-can-use-configuration-service-providers).
- **Setting description**: Optionally, enter a description for the setting.
- **Data type**: Choose from the following data types:
    - **String**
    - **String (XML)**
    - **Date and time**
    - **Integer**
    - **Floating point**
    - **Boolean**
- **OMA-URI (case sensitive)**: Specify the OMA-URI you want to supply a setting for.
- **Value**: Specify the value to associate with the OMA-URI that you entered.

### Example
In the following screenshot, the setting **Connectivity/AllowVPNOverCellular** has been enabled. This lets a Windows 10 device open a VPN connection when it's on a cellular network.

### How to find the policies you can configure

You’ll find a complete list of all configuration service providers (CSPs) that Windows 10 supports in the [Configuration service provider reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/customize/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference) in the Windows documentation library.

Not all settings are compatible with all Windows 10 versions. The table in the Windows topic tells you which versions are supported for each CSP.

Additionally, Intune does not support all of the settings listed in the topic. To find out if Intune supports the setting you want, open the topic for that setting. Each setting page shows it’s supported operation. To work with Intune, the setting must support the **Add** or **Replace** operations.

## General configuration policy settings

Use the Microsoft Intune **general configuration policy** for Windows 10 to configure built-in settings for enrolled Windows 10 desktop and Windows 10 Mobile devices.
