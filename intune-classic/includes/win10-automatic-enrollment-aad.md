## Enable Windows 10 automatic enrollment

Automatic enrollment lets users enroll their Windows 10 devices in Intune when adding their work account to their personally-owned devices or joining their corporate-owned devices to your Azure Active Directory. In the background, the user's device registers and joins Azure Active Directory. Once registered, the device is managed with Intune.

**Prerequisites**
- Azure Active Directory Premium subscription ([trial subscription](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=816845))
- Microsoft Intune subscription

   - **MDM Discovery URL**

By default, two-factor authentication is not enabled for the service. However, two-factor authentication is recommended when registering a device. Before requiring two-factor authentication for this service, you must configure a two-factor authentication provider in Azure Active Directory and configure your user accounts for multi-factor authentication. See [Getting started with the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-get-started-cloud).
