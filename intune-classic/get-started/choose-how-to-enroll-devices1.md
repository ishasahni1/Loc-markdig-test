- **Users-owned devices** - "BYOD” (Bring your own device) enrollment – Users can install the Intune Company Portal app on their device and then enroll it, gaining access to company resources like email, company apps, company data, and support.  

- **Company-owned devices** - Company-owned devices (COD) can be enrolled in a variety of ways, depending upon the needs of the organization and the types of devices being managed.
