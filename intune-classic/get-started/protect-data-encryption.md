# Quick Start Guide: Protect company data with data encryption

[!INCLUDE[classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

Microsoft Intune can help you prevent data loss from Office mobile apps in a variety of ways, including:
- By encrypting corporate data with the highest level of device encryption provided by iOS and Android.
- On iOS and Android devices that, because of privacy or legal requirements, cannot be enrolled in a mobile device management solution.

Microsoft Intune can also help you prevent data loss from Office mobile apps and secure Office 365 (O365) data without having to enroll iOS or Android mobile devices in full mobile device management. This is true even if you use a third-party mobile device management solution to managed mobile devices.

## Is this quick start guide right for me?
This quick start guide is a good resource if you meet the following prerequisites:
- You already use or have O365 licenses that you want to use and you manage Office mobile apps.
- You are planning to use Office mobile apps on iOS or Android.
- You use any mobile device management solution - Microsoft or non-Microsoft. If you cannot use a mobile device management solution because of statutory rules, this guide is something that you can use.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows is not yet a supported platform for Office mobile apps. Mobile application management without enrollment is not yet compatible with Exchange or SharePoint on-premise. You can only protect data hosted in online versions.

This guide can help you protect your company from data loss by forcing passcodes and data encryption using policies on the mobile apps that your employees use to access sensitive data, without requiring full enrollment in any device management solution. Microsoft Intune allows you to set mobile application management (MAM) policies on Office mobile apps for [iOS](https://products.office.com/mobile/office-mobile-apps-for-ios) and [Android](https://products.office.com/mobile/office-mobile-apps-for-android). This approach protects O365 data without requiring users to enroll their devices into a mobile device management solution while also maintaining a great end-user experience with Office mobile apps.

## How do I do it?
