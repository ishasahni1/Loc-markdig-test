This capability provides a better end-user experience and reduces overall helpdesk costs by driving down the number of escalations for email configuration issues on your users Windows, iOS, and Android devices.

After the email profile is configured, you can easily restrict access to company email and Office 365 services with Intune conditional access policies.
