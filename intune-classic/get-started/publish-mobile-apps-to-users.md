# Quick Start Guide: Publish mobile apps to your users

[!INCLUDE[classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

Microsoft Intune can help increase your end users’ productivity by quickly and easily giving them access to the mobile and desktop apps they need from the devices of their choice. Making apps easily available to end users reduces the time and effort users spend searching for and installing the correct apps, which reduces helpdesk calls when users cannot find the apps they need.   

## Is this quick start guide right for me?
Would you like your users to quickly have access to all the apps they need to be productive at work, presented in a common portal regardless of the type of device they use?

If yes, Microsoft Intune allows you to publish apps (Office mobile, internal line of business or other mobile and desktop apps) in a single common portal: the [Intune Company Portal app or website](/intune-user-help/company-portal-frequently-asked-questions).

## How do I do it?
1.	[Enroll devices](/intune-classic/deploy-use/enroll-devices-in-microsoft-intune) into Intune mobile device management.
2.	[Add apps to Intune](/intune-classic/deploy-use/add-apps-for-mobile-devices-in-microsoft-intune) that you want to deploy to enrolled devices.
3.	[Deploy apps using Intune](/intune-classic/deploy-use/deploy-apps) to enrolled devices.

### Additional information:
If publishing Office mobile apps is done with the intention of using Intune’s MAM capabilities to manage data loss protection for those apps, then each end user assigned MAM policies will need to be [assigned a user license for Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Assign-or-remove-licenses-for-Office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc).
