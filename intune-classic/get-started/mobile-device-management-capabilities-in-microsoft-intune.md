# Enrolled device management capabilities of Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

Microsoft Intune lets you manage a range of devices by *enrolling* them into the service. You can enroll some device types yourself, or users can enroll using the *company portal* app. This also lets them perform operations like browsing and installing apps, ensuring that their devices are compliant with company policies, and contacting their IT support.

This topic gives a full list of the capabilities that you get after you enroll your device.

Management, inventory, app deployment, provisioning, and retirement are all handled through the Intune administration console. Users gain access to the company portal, which enables them to install apps, enroll and remove devices, and contact their IT department or helpdesk.



## Device security and configuration

|Capability|Details|More information|
|--------------|-----------|--------------------|
|Configuration policies<br><br>Custom policies| Lets you manage many settings and features on mobile devices in your organization. For example, you can  require a password, limit the number of failed attempts, limit the amount of time before the screen locks, set password expiration, and prevent previously used passwords. You can also control the use of hardware and software features such as the device camera or the web browser.<br><br>Use custom polices when configuration policies do not contain the settings that you require. For iOS devices, you can import settings that you exported from the Apple Configurator tool. For other devices, you can use Open Mobile Alliance Uniform Resource Identifier (OMA-URI) settings to configure settings and features on the device.|[Manage settings and features on your devices with Microsoft Intune policies](/intune-classic/deploy-use/manage-settings-and-features-on-your-devices-with-microsoft-intune-policies)|
|Remote Wipe, Remote Lock, and Passcode Reset|Erases sensitive data when a device is lost or stolen. For example, you can remotely lock the device, restore it to factory settings, or wipe only corporate data.<br><br>You can reset passcodes if users lose access to their device, lock missing or stolen devices, or even wipe data off of missing or stolen devices.|[Help protect your devices with remote lock and passcode reset](/intune-classic/deploy-use/retire-devices-from-microsoft-intune-management)|
