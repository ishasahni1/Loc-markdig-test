# Troubleshoot client setup in Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE[classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

Use the following information to help you troubleshoot common client setup problems. If this information does not solve your problem, see [How to get support for Microsoft Intune](how-to-get-support-for-microsoft-intune.md) to find more ways to get help.

## Client installation fails

-   If no client software deployment alerts for the computer are displayed in the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/) check the computer’s Internet connectivity and proxy configuration and make sure that the computer can communicate with the service URL, [https://manage.microsoft.com](https://manage.microsoft.com/). Then retry the client software installation.

-   You can have an email sent to selected recipients when a client software deployment failure alert occurs by configuring a notification rule in the **Admin** workspace. For more information, see [Get notified by Microsoft Intune alerts](/intune-classic/deploy-use/get-notified-by-alerts).

-   Intune displays the critical alert **Client Software Deployment Failure** if the client software fails to deploy. This will display in the **System Overview** page and **Alerts** pages of the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/). Here's how to check for alerts:

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), choose **Alerts** &gt; **Overview**.

2.  On the **Alerts overview** page, you can review the following information:

    -   The top three alerts, which can be sorted by date, category, or severity

    -   The total number of active alerts

3.  Choose **All Alerts** to display the following information on the **Alerts** page. Critical alerts are displayed first:

    -   **Name** – The name of the alert type that generated the alert.

    -   **Source** – A link to the source of the alert.  If the display threshold of the alert type is set to **All**, then this link will display a single affected device.  If the display threshold of the alert type is set to a value, then this link will display a list of all the devices that are affected by this alert.

    -   **Last Updated** – This indicates the time when the alert was last modified. If an alert is closed, the time when the alert was closed is displayed.

    -   **Severity** – This indicates the severity of the alert

## Computer enrollment package doesn't download
**Issue:** While trying to enroll a computer you experience the following:
-  The enrollment package fails to download
-  The download dialog appears but times out

**Resolution:** On the browser you're using for the download, for the period when the download takes place, ensure that downloads are enabled, and that encrypted files can be saved to your local disc.

## Client installation hangs with error code 0x80040154
**Issue:**

-  Client installation during enrollment hangs

-  Unable to enroll device

-  Error 0x80040154 in WindowsUpdate.log

This may be caused by the absence of critical software updates on the PC.

**Resolution:**
Ensure that your software update policy enables installation of critical updates, as described in [Keep Windows PCs up to date with software updates in Microsoft Intune](/intune-classic/deploy-use/keep-windows-pcs-up-to-date-with-software-updates-in-microsoft-intune)


## Microsoft Intune policy-related errors in policyplatform.log
For non-MDM Windows devices, policy errors in the policyplatform.log file may be the result of non-default settings in the Windows User Account Control (UAC) on the device. Some non-default UAC settings can affect Microsoft Intune client installations and policy execution.

### To resolve UAC issues

1.  Retire the computer, as described in [Retire data and devices from Microsoft Intune management](/intune-classic/deploy-use/retire-devices-from-microsoft-intune-management).

2.  Wait 20 minutes for the client software to be removed.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Do not attempt to remove the client from Programs and Features.

3.  On the start menu type **UAC** to open the User Account Control settings.

4.  Move  the notification slider to the default setting.

## What to do if the client will not uninstall from the Microsoft Intune administrator console

### To remove the client software by using the Microsoft Intune command line tool

1.  Open a command prompt in administrator mode.

2.  Go to the folder *%programfiles%\Microsoft\OnlineManagement\Common*

3.  Run the following command ``ProvisioningUtil.exe /UninstallAgents /MicrosoftIntune``

## Client installation error codes
The following table describes error codes that are displayed in **Alerts** if client software installation fails. It includes suggestions for resolving the problem that is represented by each error code.

Have the client computer enrollment log (located in %*programfiles*%\Microsoft\OnlineManagement\Logs\Enrollment.log and %*userprofile*%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OnlineManagement\Logs\Enrollement.log) and Windows Update log (%*windir*%\windowsupdate.log) available to show to support engineers.

## What to do if Endpoint Protection is not uninstalled when you uninstall the client

Sometimes the Host Protection (Endpoint Protection) agent may be left after you run the above commands. If that happens, run this command from an elevated prompt:

    ```
    "C:\Program Files\Managed Defender\Setup.exe" /x /q /s
    ```
