# General troubleshooting tips for Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

After you deploy Microsoft Intune, you might encounter problems with your configuration or with client devices. Use the following resources to help you discover what's causing the problem so you can resolve it.

> [!NOTE]
> To create a support request, or to view an existing request, [visit the Office 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/admin/default.aspx). For more information about support options, see [How to get support for Microsoft Intune](how-to-get-support-for-microsoft-intune.md).

## Define the problem

-   What is the behavior?

-   Who experiences this behavior, and on what platforms and devices?

-   Did the device work properly previously?

-   What changes did you make to the Intune or device configuration?

-   Were other changes were made to the environment in which you operate, other than configuration changes?

-   How frequently does this problem occur, and is it sporadic or consistent?

-   Could the user be experiencing an authentication issue? If this is a possiblity, see if the user can sign in to other services that use Azure Active Directory. Also, see if the user can sign in from a different device.

-   Have you checked the service status? You can monitor Intune service health in the [Office 365 management portal](https://portal.office.com/Admin/Default.aspx). Choose **Service Health** in the left pane.

## Collect available data

- The following resources can help you learn how to collect device logs:
  - [Send Android diagnostic data logs to your IT administrator using a USB cable](/intune-user-help/send-diagnostic-data-logs-to-your-it-administrator-using-a-usb-cable-android)
  - [Send Android diagnostic data logs to your IT administrator using email](/intune-user-help/send-diagnostic-data-logs-to-your-it-administrator-using-email-android)
  - [Send Android enrollment errors to your IT administrator](/intune-user-help/send-enrollment-errors-to-your-it-administrator-android)
  - [Send iOS enrollment errors to your IT administrator](/intune-user-help/send-errors-to-your-it-admin-ios)

- With admin console data (for example, for policy implementation issues), examine the intended policy and the status of that policy, as described in [Use groups to manage users and devices with Microsoft Intune](/intune-classic/deploy-use/use-groups-to-manage-users-and-devices-with-microsoft-intune).

## Research the solution

-   Search the Web for a solution. For example, if you receive the error 0x80073CF0, search for **technet intune 0x80073cf0** on the Web, and you'll find the article [Troubleshoot app deployment problems in Microsoft Intune](troubleshoot-app-deployment-problems-in-microsoft-intune.md). This article offers suggestions for addressing this error.

-   Search for an answer in the [Intune TechNet forum](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=microsoftintuneprod).  If the issue hasn't been previously addressed, post the question to see what suggestions the community might have.

-   Open a support request. Intune Support will be better able to help you resolve an issue after you've defined the problem and have collected the available data.

    To create a support request, [visit the Office 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/admin/default.aspx). For more information about support options, see [How to get support for Microsoft Intune](how-to-get-support-for-microsoft-intune.md).
