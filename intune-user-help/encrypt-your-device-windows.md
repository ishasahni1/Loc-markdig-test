# How to protect your Windows device using encryption

When you encrypt a device, you are wrapping the information on it in a layer of protective code that prevents unauthorized people from accessing it. As a step towards making sure your information is secured, your organization is requiring you to encrypt your Windows device to protect company or school data.

> [!Note]
> If you have a Windows phone and have enrolled it, your device will be encrypted automatically if encryption is required.

If you have a desktop device, the following instructions describe how to encrypt it.

1.  Search for and then start the **Manage BitLocker** app.

2.  Choose **Turn on BitLocker**, and then follow the instructions to encrypt each of your drives.
