# Enroll your Windows 10 devices in Intune

Enrolling your devices into Microsoft Intune allows your Windows 10 devices to get access to your organizationâ€™s secure data, including email, files, and other resources. This is true for both Windows 10 desktop and Windows 10 Mobile devices. Enrolling your devices helps secure this access for both you and your organization, and helps keep your work data separate from your personal data.
