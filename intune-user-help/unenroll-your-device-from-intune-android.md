# How to unenroll your Android device from Intune

When you unenroll your Android device from Intune, your device can no longer access company resources.  For more about what happens when you unenroll, see [What happens if you unenroll your device from Intune?](what-happens-if-you-unenroll-your-device-from-intune-android.md)

To unenroll your device from Intune and remove the Company Portal app, follow these steps:

1. Open the **action menu** by tapping the three vertical dots at the top right corner of the Company Portal app.

2. Tap **Remove Company Portal**.

3. A confirmation will pop up, asking you if you're sure that you want to remove the Company Portal. It will provide some information about what happens when you unenroll your device. After reading over this message, tap **OK** to remove the app. 

  ![An image of the confirmation dialog, that is available after selecting the new "remove company portal" option from the action menu. The dialog informs the user that "by removing company portal, your device will no longer be managed by your company support and may remove access to company data, company apps, and company email." It then asks the user to confirm that they want to remove the Company Portal app by selecting "Yes".](./media/android_remove_cp_menu_confirmation_after_1705.png)
