# Enroll your Windows 10 device in Intune

> [!NOTE]
> Windows 10 works across all types of devices. Whether you're using a desktop, phone, or tablet, the steps you follow are the same - even if they look slightly different from the images on this page.

1. Go to **Start**.

  - If you are on a **Windows 10 Mobile** device, go to the **Start screen**, then swipe to the **All Apps** list.

2.  Open the Windows **Settings** app by searching for "settings" in the search bar.

3. Select **Accounts** > **Access work or school** > **Connect**.
