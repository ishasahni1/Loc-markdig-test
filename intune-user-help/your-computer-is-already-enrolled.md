# Your computer is already enrolled

If you receive an error that your computer is already enrolled, your computer has already been added to the Company Portal, but the computer is not linked to your user account yet. Follow this procedure to link your computer to your user account and finish the process.  

To link your computer:

1.  On the computer that you want to link to your account, choose **Start**, and then choose **Microsoft Intune Center**.

2.  Open the Company Portal.

3.  Follow the prompts to link the computer to your user account.

If you prefer to unenroll your device, use the instructions for the type of device you have: [Android](unenroll-your-device-from-intune-android.md), [iOS](unenroll-your-device-from-intune-ios.md), or [Windows](unenroll-your-device-from-intune-windows.md).

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog).
