# Reset your device from the Company Portal website

If your device gets lost or stolen, you might want to reset it to its factory default settings to prevent unauthorized access to your data. You can reset your device remotely by using the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog). The Company Portal website is a web page that you can use to manage computers and devices that you have enrolled in Intune. You can use this website to do most of the same tasks that you can do when using your Company Portal app.

If you reset your device, it will no longer be listed in the Company Portal, and the device will be reset to its factory default settings.

> [!Note]
> You can also perform the following steps from another device that you've enrolled by opening the Company Portal app on that device and going through similar steps to complete the reset. 

To reset your device:

1. On the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog), tap the __menu__ button, then select __My Devices__.

2. On the __My Devices__ page, select the name of the device you want to rename.

3. The device will open in a popup window. Tap the **Reset** button.

   ![All options for a selected device on the Company Portal website, including Rename, Remove, Reset Device, Reset Passcode, and Remote Lock. ](./media/iwp-screen-with-all-options.png)

4. A warning message will appear to let you know that you are about to erase all content on your device by resetting it to the factory default settings. Tap **Reset** to confirm that this is what you want to do.

Your device has now been reset.
