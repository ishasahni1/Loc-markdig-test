# Enroll your legacy macOS device in Intune

These instructions will work for macOS devices on OS X Yosemite 10.10 and previous. You can find instructions for enrolling macOS devices on newer versions of macOS [here](enroll-your-device-in-intune-macos-cp.md).

Getting access to your organizationâ€™s apps, data, and resources makes it possible for you to do your job. If you're using a macOS device at work, this means installing a __Management Profile__. This is simply a file set up by your company support that loads settings and access information onto your Mac. Want to know more? Find out [what happens when you install the Company Portal app and enroll your device in Intune](what-happens-if-you-install-the-company-portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios.md)

1. On your __Dock__, find __Safari__ and open a new window, then open the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog).
2. Log into the Company Portal website with your work or school account.

   [!INCLUDE [wit_nextref](includes/end-user-password-guidance.md)]


3. After logging in, click on the **Menu** in the top left corner of the page and select **My Devices**.

   ![A screenshot of the landing page for the web portal with the web portal showing that no apps can be installed yet, with a My Devices button underneath.](./media/macOS_enroll_001_landing_page.png)

4. On the __My Devices__ page, you will either see a list of enrolled devices or simply a banner. This depends on if you already have a device enrolled, macOS or otherwise. To enroll a device that is not listed, select the banner that says __If your device is listed, tap here to identify it. You can also tap here to enroll your device if it is not listed__. If you don't have any enrolled devices, the banner will read **You don't have any devices enrolled. Enroll this one by tapping here.**

   ![A screenshot of the My Device page, with a couple of unidentified devices above the banner prompt to enroll unlisted devices or identify unidentified ones.](./media/macOS_enroll_002_tap_here_banner.png)

5. A popup window will appear with a brief explanation of why you are going to __Identify or enroll this device__. Review this, then click __Enroll__ to proceed.

6. A second popup window will appear with a brief explanation of what will happen when you __Enroll this device__. Review this, then click __Install__ to proceed.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Intune needs access to your computer to make sure that your device is secure enough to access your organization's resources. Find out [what happens when you enroll your device in Intune](what-happens-if-you-install-the-Company-Portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios.md).

7. __System Preferences__ will open, and ask you if you want to __Install "Management Profile"?__ Click __Install__ to proceed, or get more details by clicking __Show Profile__.

8. A macOS popup window will appear. Confirm that you want to make changes by providing your computer's __User Name__ and __Password__, then clicking __OK__. This will install the management profile onto your Mac.

9. You may see some additional messages from your Mac with more details about the profile, or whether you're sure that you want to __Install__. Click __Continue__ and __Install__ through these to proceed. Once the installation finishes, you will be able to view your newly-installed __Management Profile__ in the list of __Device Profiles__.

Some profiles may say that they're **Unverified**; as long as they're from your company, this is normal.
