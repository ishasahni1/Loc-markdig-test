# Send enrollment errors to your company support

If you get an error while trying to enroll your Android device in Intune, you can try enrolling again by tapping **Retry**. If this doesn't work, you can send information about what's happening to your company support in an email by tapping **Send info**.

When you tap **Send info**, an email is created automatically. The email is addressed to your company support, and contains the information, or _logs_, that your company support needs to help troubleshoot your device.

There are different ways you can send your device's data logs to your company support to get help with errors:

- [Use the Send Info button to email logs](send-logs-to-your-it-admin-by-email-android.md)
- [Use a USB cable to send logs as an email attachment](send-logs-to-your-it-admin-using-cable-android.md)
