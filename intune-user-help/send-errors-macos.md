# Submit errors to the right people for your managed macOS device

If you get errors on your macOS device while using the Company Portal app, you can send information to help your company support troubleshoot the problem.

## Send errors to your company support

 You can send error information to your company support in different ways:

-   On error alert messages, click **Report**.

-   In the **Help** menu of the Company Portal app, click **Save Diagnostic Report**. Choose a location to save the file. You can email or upload this file to your company support, depending on your company.

- If your email app is already configured, you can also send the diagnostic report by going to **Help** > **Send Diagnostic Report**.

## Send errors to the Company Portal developers for macOS devices

Sometimes the Company Portal app may act unexpectedly. These issues are ones that the app developers want to hear about, as it can help us make it work better for you and prevent strange behavior from happening in the future. This information is kept on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic report_.

If you need to send diagnostic reports to the Microsoft team that develops the Company Portal app, you'll need to provide some information to try and diagnose the root cause. Instead of sending it to your company support team, use <a href="mailto:IntuneCPiOSfeedback@microsoft.com?subject=My Company Portal App Closed Unexpectedly&body=Press and hold, then paste your copied Company Portal app logs here.">this email template</a> to send it to Microsoft.
