# Resolve a threat found by a Mobile Threat Defense app

Mobile Threat Defense has found a potential threat on your iOS device, and you must fix the issue to regain access to your company or school email, apps, and files. Depending on how your company has set up Mobile Threat Defense, you will use one of the following apps to resolve these kinds of issues.


* [Lookout for Work](you-need-to-resolve-a-threat-found-by-lookout-for-work-ios.md)
* [Symantec Endpoint Protection Mobile](you-need-to-resolve-a-threat-found-by-skycure-ios.md)
* [SandBlast Mobile Protect](you-need-to-resolve-a-threat-found-by-checkpoint-ios.md)
* [Zimperium zIPS](you-need-to-resolve-a-threat-found-by-zips-ios.md)

To resolve the issue, open the Mobile Threat Defense app, and follow the instructions shown in the app.

**Example of an app that Mobile Threat Defense sees as a threat**

If you have installed an app that Mobile Threat Defense thinks is a threat, you will see a screen that tells you what the threatening app is. If you see something like this, tap the app name shown at the top of your screen, and follow the instructions to remove the threat.

After you uninstall the app, you regain access to your email and other company or school data right away. If you ignore the request to uninstall the app, you will lose access to your company email and data until you uninstall the app.
