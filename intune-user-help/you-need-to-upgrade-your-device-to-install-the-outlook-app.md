# You need to upgrade your device to install the Outlook app

The Outlook app helps millions of users connect all their email accounts, calendars and files in one convenient spot for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook-email-calendar/id951937596?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.outlook) devices.

If you're trying to download Outlook and, instead of installing, a message pops up on your device that says that your device's operating system isn't current enough. You'll need to upgrade your device to install Outlook.

## If you have an Android device
Go to **Settings**, and then use the **update** or **system update** option.

## If you have an iOS device
Tap **Settings** > **General** > **Software Update**.
