# An existing company email account was found

You've already got an email account with your organization or company, and now you want to access that account on your mobile device. Your company support needs your help to keep your email access secure on its journey from the person who sent it to your device. Your current email may have worked, but taking these steps will keep your information safer.

1.  Find the **Settings** for your device and remove the connection you previously set up to your company email.

    For example, on an iOS device, tap **Settings** > **Mail** > **Accounts**. Select your work email account then tap **Delete**.

2.  Exit **Settings** and open the Company Portal app on your device, then tap **Check Compliance**.

3.  Wait a short time for new email settings to be applied to your device automatically.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog).
