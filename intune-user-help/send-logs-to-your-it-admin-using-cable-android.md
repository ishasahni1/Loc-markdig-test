# Send logs to your company support using a USB cable

If you get an error while youâ€™re using the Company Portal app on your Android device, you can help your company support troubleshoot the problem by sending them information through email. This information is kept on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_.

> [!Note]
> Before you start, make sure that you have your company support's email address handy. You can find this on the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog) or in your Company Portal app.

1. On the error screen, tap **Send Info**. When you see a message asking which method you want to use to send the logs, choose the option that will save the files to your device.

2. Connect your device to your computer with the USB cable. This is generally the same cable used to charge your device in a wall outlet.

3. On the computer, look for a directory that has the name of your device. In that directory, find <strong>Android Device\Phone\Android\data\com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal\files\</strong>.

4. Select the files, and attach them to an email. Send this email to your company support.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog).
