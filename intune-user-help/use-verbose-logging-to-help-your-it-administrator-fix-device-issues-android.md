# Help your company support fix device issues with verbose logging

When your Android device is enrolled in Intune, you can use *verbose logging* to make the Company Portal app and Intune-managed apps record detailed logs about what's happening on your device. These logs help your company support fix any issues that you might have when you're using the Company Portal or an app that's managed by Intune. Verbose logging is enabled on your device  by default, and the  logs that are sent to your company support include your email address.

To turn verbose logging on or off, sign in to the Company Portal app using your work or school credentials, tap **Settings**, and tap the on/off button next to **Verbose Logging**.
