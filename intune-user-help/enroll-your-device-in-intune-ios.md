# Set up access to your company resources

Your company has lots of proprietary information, from email, to files, networks, and more. Your company is using Microsoft Intune to help protect that information when you access it from your iOS device. This lets them manage those resources, keep them more secure, and give you the freedom to use your preferred device to get your work done.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're trying to access company email in the Mail app, it's likely that you were prompted to manage your device to keep it secure. Follow the instructions below to get access to your email and other company resources on your iOS device.

## Before you start

- Make sure that you finish the entire process once you start. Pausing for more than a few minutes usually stops your progress and requires you to start over.
- If this process should fail, you need to return to the Company Portal app to try again.
- Make sure that your Wi-Fi is working, and that Safari works on your device.
- Download and install the [Intune Company Portal app](install-and-sign-in-to-the-intune-company-portal-app-ios.md).
