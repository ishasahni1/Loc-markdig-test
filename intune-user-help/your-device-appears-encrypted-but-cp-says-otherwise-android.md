# Your Android device seems to be encrypted, but Company Portal says otherwise

When you encrypt a device, you are encoding the information on it using a secret key that is known only to you. This prevents unauthorized people from accessing it. Many organizations require their users to encrypt their Android devices before they can access company files, email, or data.

## Common issues

Newer versions of Android, particularly starting with v7.0, require a startup passcode to make sure that your device is fully encrypted. Different device manufacturers have varying descriptions and locations for the startup passcode. Most of the time, this setting is referred to as "Secure Startup." 

## Solutions

### Add a startup PIN

Certain Android devices require you to create a startup PIN to make sure that your device is secure. There are many versions of Android from many different manufacturers. You can try to fix this issue by finding a location in your settings app to enable this option. For example, on the Samsung Galaxy S7, you enable Secure Startup by going to **Settings** > **Lock Screen and Security** > **Secure Startup**.  

### Downgrade your version of Android

If your device offers you the option to downgrade to Android 6.0+, then do so. There is a risk of data loss if you should try to downgrade your device. Otherwise, we recommend that you contact your company support to resolve this issue. You can get contact information for your company support at the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog) for contact information.

### Encrypt the entire device

Some devices will give you a choice between encrypting the entire device or just the used space. Choose the option to encrypt the entire device rather than "only used space." If you have already encrypted only the used space:

1. [Remove this device from the Company Portal](unenroll-your-device-from-intune-android.md)
2. Decrypt the used space
3. Encrypt the entire device
4. Re-enroll the device

## Specific manufacturer issues

Some Android devices on version 7.0+ encrypt data in ways that are inconsistent with certain Android platform standards. These devices may appear encrypted even when they are brand new. Intune recognizes that these devices' encryption methods put the device's information at risk. This risk primarily stems from malicious users who have physical access to the device.
