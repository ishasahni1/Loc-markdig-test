# How to update the Company Portal app

If your version of the Company Portal app is no longer supported, or there is a newer version of the Company Portal app available, you need to update it to a later version. Use the steps  that match the type of device you have.

The Play Store alerts you when a new version of the Company Portal is available. You won't see a prompt in the Company Portal app itself. Follow the directions in the alert to update your device.

When a new version is available, you see the "update" option when you're looking at the app in your list of installed apps.  

To update the Company Portal app:
