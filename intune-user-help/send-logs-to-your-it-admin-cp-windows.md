# Send logs to your company support from the Company Portal app for Windows 10

If you get an error while youâ€™re using the Company Portal app on your Windows 10 device, you can help your company support troubleshoot the problem by sending them information through email. This information is kept on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_.

1. Open the **Company Portal** app.
2. Select the **Settings** gear, then **Send Logs**.
3. **Share** will open. Select **Mail**. This will create an email message with the Company Portal logs attached that can be sent to your company support.

   ![The Send Logs dialog from the Company Portal app's Settings page. The link to click says "Send logs - Send diagnostic logs to your company support to help them solve issues within the Company Portal."](./media/w10-share-logs-after-1711.png)

You may also need to send [logs from the Settings app](send-logs-to-your-it-admin-settings-windows.md) to give your company support more help in trying to troubleshoot any issues they may find.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog).
