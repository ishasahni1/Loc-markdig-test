# You need to update your Android device's operating system

If you've seen a message that says your â€œMinimum Android security patch level is not configured," you need to install an update to ensure that your device remains secure. A _patch_ is released to maintain software to keep it running smoothly and up to date. Your company support requires you to install this patch to make sure that corporate data is kept as protected as possible on your device. The location of the security patch you need will vary depending on whether you have a specific type of Samsung device.

If you have a Samsung device, go to **Settings** > **About phone**, and check to see if the word "KNOX" is anywhere onscreen. If so, follow the Samsung KNOX directions below.

[!INCLUDE [wit_nextref](includes/end-user-os-update-guidance.md)]

## For most Android devices (non-Samsung KNOX)

Go to **Settings** > **About** > **Software updates**. Install the update and your device should have the correct security patch installed.

## For Samsung KNOX Android devices

Go to **Settings** > **System updates** > **Check for new system update**. Install the update and your Samsung KNOX device should have the correct security patch installed.
