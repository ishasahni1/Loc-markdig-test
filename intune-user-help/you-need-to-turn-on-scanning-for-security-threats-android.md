# You need to make your device able to scan for security threats

Your Android device is able to download and install apps that can accomplish a wide variety of tasks. Not all apps are equal, though, and some apps may cause issues. A general recommendation is to download apps only from verified sources, such as the Google Play Store. One way your company support has decided to additionally protect the data on your device is by having Google scan the apps you're installing to make sure they're safe.

You can turn on this scanning by going to **Settings** > **Google** > **Security**, and turn on **Scan device for security threats**.
