# Unenroll your macOS device from Intune

When you unenroll your iOS device from Intune, your device will no longer be able to access company resources and will no longer be managed by Intune.

Follow these steps to unenroll your macOS device from management:

1.  In the Company Portal app, under **My Devices**, select the device you want to unenroll.

2.  Click  **Remove** > **Remove**.

When you unenroll your device from Intune, here's what happens:

-   Your device won’t appear in the Company Portal anymore.

-   You can’t install apps from the Company Portal anymore.

-   Any settings that were changed on your device when you added it (for example, disabling the camera, or requiring a certain password length) will no longer apply.

-   You might not have access to some company resources, such as file shares or internal web sites, on your device anymore.

-   You can’t use company apps and company data on your device anymore.

-   You might not be able to connect to your company network using Wi-Fi or a virtual private network (VPN) anymore.

-   Company email profiles are removed from the device.

-   Devices that are configured for email only won't appear in the Company Portal app or website anymore.
