# What happens if you install the Company Portal app and enroll your Android device in Intune?

When you install the Company Portal app and enroll your Android device in Intune, you can use the Company Portal app to:

-   Access the company’s network, and your email and work files.

-   Get company apps from the Company Portal.

-   Automatically set up your company email account.

-   Reset your phone to factory settings if it is lost or stolen.

When you enroll your Android device, you are giving your company support permission to access the device. They can do things like:

-   Reset your device back to the manufacturer’s defaults. This is helpful if the device is lost or stolen.

-   Remove all company-related data. Your personal data and settings aren’t removed.

-   Set requirements on your device, like requiring you to have a device password or PIN to help protect company data. Your company support might also limit how many times you can enter an incorrect password, and might lock you out of the device if you try too many times.

-   Require you to accept terms and conditions.

-   Disable the camera to prevent you from taking pictures of sensitive work material that shouldn't be shared.

-   Require that all data on the device is encrypted to help protect the data if the device is lost or stolen.

After your device is added to the Company Portal, approximately every eight hours it will:

-   Download any policy or app updates that your company support has made available.

-   Send any hardware inventory updates. (These updates do not have personal information.)

-   Send any company app inventory updates. (These updates do not have personal information.)

Need help?
