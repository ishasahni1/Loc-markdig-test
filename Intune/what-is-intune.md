# Introduction to Microsoft Intune in the Azure portal


[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Microsoft Intune is now in the Azure portal, meaning that the workflows and functionality you are used to are now different.
The new portal offers you new and updated functionality in the Azure portal where you can manage your organization's mobile devices, PCs, and apps.

* [Where did my features go in Azure?](ui-changes.md) is a reference to show you the specific workflows and UIs that have changed with the move to Azure.
* [Intune classic groups in the Azure portal](groups-get-started.md) explains the implications of the shift to Azure Active Directory security groups for group management.




You can find information about the new portal in this library, and it is continually updated. If you have suggestions you'd like to see, leave feedback in the topic comments. We'd love to hear from you.

Highlights of the new experience include:

- An integrated console for all your Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) components
- An HTML-based console built on web standards
- Microsoft Graph API support to automate many actions
- Azure Active Directory (AD) groups to provide compatibility across all your Azure applications
- Support for most modern web browsers

## Before you start

To use Intune in the Azure portal, you must have an Intune admin and tenant account. [Sign up for an account](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=40BE278A-DFD1-470a-9EF7-9F2596EA7FF9&dl=INTUNE_A&ali=1#0%20) if you don't already have one.

## Supported web browsers for the Azure portal

The Azure portal runs on most modern PCs, Macs, and tablets. Mobile phones are not supported.
Currently, the following browsers are supported:

- Microsoft Edge (latest version)
- Microsoft Internet Explorer 11
- Safari (latest version, Mac only)
- Chrome (latest version)
- Firefox (latest version)

Check the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-preview-portal-supported-browsers-devices) for the latest information about supported browsers.
