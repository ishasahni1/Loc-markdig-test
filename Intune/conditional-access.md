# What's conditional access?

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

This topic describes Conditional access as it applies to Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS), and follows that with Conditional access common scenarios when using Intune.

Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) Conditional Access is not a standalone product, itâ€™s a solution that takes part on all services and products that are part of the EMS. It provides granular access control to keep your corporate data secure, while giving users an experience that allows them to do their best work from any device, and from any location.

You can define conditions that gate access to your corporate data based on location, device, user state, and application sensitivity.

> [!NOTE] 
> Conditional Access also extends its capabilities to [Office 365 services](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/wbaer/2017/02/17/conditional-access-policies-with-sharepoint-online-and-onedrive-for-business/).
