# How to get support for Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/note-for-both-portals.md)]

Microsoft provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support for Microsoft Intune. Support is available both online and by phone for paid and trial subscriptions. Online technical support is available in English and Japanese. Phone support and online billing support are available in additional languages.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> For technical support with products that work with Intune but not made by Microsoft, for example Saaswedo, Cisco, or Lookout, contact the supplier of that product first. Before you open a request with Intune support, ensure you configured the other product correctly.

As an IT admin, you can file a support ticket from the Azure portal by using the following steps:

1. Log on to the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>) with your Intune admin credentials, choose the <strong>?</strong> icon in the upper-right corner of the portal, and then select <strong>Help + support</strong> to go to the [Azure Help + support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview target=_blank) page.
