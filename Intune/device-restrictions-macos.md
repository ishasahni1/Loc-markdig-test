# macOS device restriction settings in Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Use these settings to manage macOS devices in a device restriction profile.

## Password
-   **Password** - Require the end user to enter a password to access the device.
    -   **Required password type** - Specify whether the password can be Numeric only, or whether it must be Alphanumeric (contain letters and numbers). This setting is supported only on Mac OS X version 10.10.3 and later.
    -   **Number of non-alphanumeric characters in password** - Specify the number of complex characters required in the password (**0** to **4**).<br>A complex character is a symbol, like **?**
    -   **Minimum password length** - Enter the minimum length of password a user must configure (between **4** and **16** characters).
    -   **Simple passwords** - Allow the use of simple passwords such as **0000** or **1234**.
    -   **Maximum minutes after screen lock before password is required** - Specify how long the computer must be inactive before a password is required to unlock it.
    -   **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks** - Specify the length of time that the computer must be idle before the screen locks.
    -   **Password expiration (days)** - Specify how many days elapse before the user must change the password (**1** to **255** days).
    -   **Prevent reuse of previous passwords** - Specify the number of previously used passwords that cannot be reused (**1** to **24**).

## Restricted apps

In the restricted apps list, you can configure one of the following lists:

A **Prohibited apps** list - List the apps (not managed by Intune) that users are not allowed to install and run.
An **Approved apps** list - List the apps that users are allowed to install. To remain compliant, users must not install apps that are not listed. Apps that are managed by Intune are automatically allowed.

To configure the list, click **Add**, then specify a name of your choice, optionally the app publisher, and the bundle ID of the app (for example *com.apple.calculator*).

## Domains

### Unmarked email domains

In the **Email Domain URL** field, add one or more URLs to the list. When end users receive an email from a domain other than one you configured, the email is marked as untrusted in the iOS Mail app.
