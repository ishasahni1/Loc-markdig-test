## App Store

-   **App store** - Lets users connect to the app store from the device.

## Restricted apps

In the restricted apps list, you can configure one of the following lists:

A **Blocked apps** list - List the apps (not managed by Intune) that users are not allowed to install and run.
An **Allowed apps** list - List the apps that users are allowed to install. Apps that are managed by Intune are automatically allowed.

To configure the list, click **Add**, then specify a name of your choice, optionally the app publisher, and the URL to the app in the app store.

### How to specify the URL to an app in the store

To specify an app URL in the allowed and blocked apps list, use the following format:

From the [Windows Phone Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/windows-phone) page, search for the app that you want to use.

Open the app’s page, and copy the URL to the clipboard. You can now use this as the URL in either the allowed or blocked apps list.

Example: Search the store for the Skype app. The URL you use will be **http://www.windowsphone.com/store/app/skype/c3f8e570-68b3-4d6a-bdbb-c0a3f4360a51**.



### Additional options

You can also click **Import** to populate the list from a csv file in the format <*app url*>, <*app name*>, <*app publisher*> or click **Export** to create a csv file containing the contents of the restricted apps list in the same format.
