# Reduce help desk costs with self-service password reset

You can allow employees to reset work and school account passwords without help desk assistance. This type of self-service password reset is recommended in the following situations:
* Your company and school uses Azure Active Directory for work and school accounts.
* Your employees and students have internet access.
* You want to lower help desk costs.

## Action plan

1. Understand [Azure Active Directory self-service password reset](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-passwords-overview). 
2. Ask employees and students to [register for self-service password reset](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-passwords-reset-register).
3. For future reference, give employees and students instructions for [how to reset or change a password](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-passwords-update-your-own-password).
