- Host pairing 
- Cloud Sync 
- Spotlight search 
- Handoff 
- Erase device 
- Restrictions UI 
- Installation of configuration profiles by UI 
- News 
- Keyboard shortcuts 
- Passcode modifications

> [!NOTE]
> Apple confirmed that certain settings will move to supervised-only in 2018. We recommend taking this into consideration when using these settings instead of waiting for Apple to migrate them to supervised-only:
> - App installation by end users
> - App removal
> - FaceTime
> - Safari
> - iTunes
> - Explicit content
> - iCloud documents and data
> - Multiplayer gaming
> - Add Game Center friends

## Password
-   **Password** - Require the end user to enter a password to access the device.
    -   **Simple passwords** - Allow simple passwords like 0000 and 1234.
    -   **Required password type** - Specify the type of password that will be required, such as numeric only or alphanumeric.
    -   **Number of non-alphanumeric characters in password** - Specify the number of symbol characters (like **#** or **@**) that must be included in the password.
    -   **Minimum password length** - Specify the minimum number of characters in the password.
    -   **Number of sign-in failures before wiping device** - Specify the number of failed login attempts before this setting wipes the device.
    -   **Maximum minutes after screen lock before password is required**<sup>1</sup> - Specify how long the device can remain idle before the user must re-enter their password.
    -   **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks**<sup>1</sup> - Specify the number of minutes before the device display is turned off.
    -   **Password expiration (days)** - Specify the number of days before the device password must be changed.
    -   **Prevent reuse of previous passwords** - Specify the number of previously used passwords that the device remembers.
    -   **Fingerprint unlock** - Allow using a fingerprint to unlock compatible devices.

<sup>1</sup>When you configure the settings **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks** and **Maximum minutes after screen lock before password is required**, they are applied in sequence. For example, if you set the value for both settings to **5** minutes, the screen will turn off automatically after 5 minutes, and the device will be locked after an additional 5 minutes. However, if the user turns off the screen manually, the second setting is immediately applied. In the same example, after the user turns off the screen, the device will lock 5 minutes later.

## Restricted apps

In the restricted apps list, you can configure one of the following lists:

- A **Prohibited apps** list - List the apps (not managed by Intune) that users are not allowed to install and run. Users are not prevented from installing a prohibited app, but if they do so, this will be reported to you.
- An **Approved apps** list - List the apps that users are allowed to install. Users must not install apps that are not listed. Apps that are managed by Intune are automatically allowed. Users are not prevented from installing an app that is not on the approved list, but if they do so, this will be reported to you.

To configure the list, click **Add**, then specify a name of your choice, optionally the app publisher, and the URL to the app in the app store.

### How to specify the URL to an app in the store

To specify an app URL in the apps list, use the following format:

Using a search engine, find the app that you want to use in the iTunes App Store and open the page for the app.
Copy the URL of the page and use this as the URL to configure the allowed or prohibited apps list or an app that you want to run in kiosk mode.
Device profiles that contain restricted app settings must be assigned to groups of users.

Example: Search for Microsoft Word for iPad. The URL that you use will be https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-word-for-ipad/id586447913?mt=8.

> [!Note]
> You can also use iTunes to find the app and then use the **Copy Link** command to get the app URL.

### Additional options

You can also click **Import** to populate the list from a csv file in the format <*app url*>, <*app name*>, <*app publisher*> or click **Export** to create a csv file containing the contents of the restricted apps list in the same format.

## Show or hide apps (supervised only)

In the show or hide apps list, you can configure one of the following lists (requires supervised devices running iOS 9.3 or later).

A **Hidden apps** list - Specify a list of apps that will be hidden from users. Users cannot view, or launch these apps.
An **Visible apps** list - Specify a list of apps that users can view and launch. No other apps can be viewed or launched.

To configure the list, click **Add**, then specify a name of your choice, optionally the app publisher, and the URL to the app in the app store.

### How to specify the URL to an app in the store

To specify an app URL in the apps list, use the following format:

Using a search engine, find the app that you want to use in the iTunes App Store and open the page for the app.
Copy the URL of the page and use this as the URL to configure the allowed or prohibited apps list or an app that you want to run in kiosk mode.

Example: Search for Microsoft Word for iPad. The URL that you use will be https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-word-for-ipad/id586447913?mt=8.

> [!Note]
> You can also use the iTunes software to find the app and then use the **Copy Link** command to get the app URL.

### Additional options

You can also click **Import** to populate the list from a csv file in the format <*app url*>, <*app name*>, <*app publisher*> or click **Export** to create a csv file containing the contents of the hidden or visible apps list in the same format.
