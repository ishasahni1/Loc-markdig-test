# Email profile settings for Android  devices in Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

As an Intune admin, you can create and assign email settings to the following Android devices:
- [Android Samsung KNOX Standard](#android-samsung-knox-standard-email-settings)
- [Android for Work](#android-for-work-email-settings)

## Android Samsung KNOX Standard email settings
- **Email server** - The host name of your Exchange server.
- **Account name** - The display name for the email account as it appears to users on their devices.
- **Username attribute from AAD** - This name is the attribute in Active Directory (AD) or Azure AD used to generate the username for this email profile. Select **Primary SMTP Address**, such as user1@contoso.com or **User Principal Name**, such as user1 or user1@contoso.com.
- **Email address attribute from AAD** - How the email address for the user on each device is generated. Select **Primary SMTP Address** to use the primary SMTP address to log in to Exchange or use **User Principal Name** to use the full principal name as the email address.
- **Authentication method** - Select either **Username and Password** or **Certificates** as the authentication method used by the email profile.
