# Set up Intune Certificate Connector for Symantec PKI Manager Web Service

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

This article show you how to install and configure Intune Certificate Connector to issue PKCS Certificates from a Symantec PKI Manager Web Service to Intune managed devices.

The Symantec PKI Manager Web Service is referred as Symantec CA throughout this article. If you already configured Intune Certificate Connector to issue PKCS Certificates and SCEP Certificates from Microsoft Certification Authority (CA), the same Connector can be used to configure and issue PKCS Certificates from a Symantec CA. In this case, Intune Certificate Connector can issue the following cetificates:

* PKCS Certificates from a Microsoft CA
* SCEP Certificates from a Microsoft CA
* PKCS Certificates from a Symantec CA

If you want to use Intune Certificate Connector for Microsoft CA and Symantec CA, you must complete the Intune Certificate Connector confuration for the Microsoft CA first then follow these steps to configure it for the Symantec CA.  For more details about configuring Intune Certificate Connector for a Microsoft CA, see [How to configure certificates in Microsoft Intune](certificates-configure.md).

## Prepare to install Intune Certificate Connector

If you are already using Intune Certificate Connector for an existing Microsoft CA, and you want to add Symantec CA support, skip this step and continue the remaining steps after you install the latest Intune Certificate Connector from the Intune Admin portal. This step is required only when you want to use Intune Certificate Connector for a Symantec CA standalone.

1. Choose one of the Windows Operating System versions from the following list and install it on a computer:
   * Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter
   * Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard
   * Windows Server 2016 Datacenter
   * Windows Server 2016 Standard

2. Create a user with administrative privileges and use it to complete the following steps.

3. Update for latest Windows Updates and install them if available.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > After installing Windows Updates, restart the computer.

4. Install .NET Framework 3.5:

    a. Open **Control Panel** > **Programs and Features** > **Turn Windows features on or off**

    b. Select **.NET Framework 3.5** and install it.

## Install the Symantec Registration Authorization Certificate

Use the following steps to get the Registration Authorization (RA) certificate from the Symantec CA. You must have an active subscription at the Symantec CA to get the RA Certificate.

1. Save the following code snippet as in a file named **certreq.ini** and update as required (For example: *Subject name in CN format*).

   ```
    [Version] 
    Signature="$Windows NT$" 

    [NewRequest] 
    ;Change to your,country code, company name and common name 
    Subject = "Subject Name in CN format"

    KeySpec = 1 
    KeyLength = 2048 
    Exportable = TRUE 
    MachineKeySet = TRUE 
    SMIME = False 
    PrivateKeyArchive = FALSE 
    UserProtected = FALSE 
    UseExistingKeySet = FALSE 
    ProviderName = "Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider" 
    ProviderType = 12 
    RequestType = PKCS10 
    KeyUsage = 0xa0 

    [EnhancedKeyUsageExtension] 
    OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2 ; Client Authentication  // Uncomment if you need a mutual TLS authentication

    ;----------------------------------------------- 
   ```

2. Open an elevated command prompt and generate CSR content using the following command:

   `Certreq.exe -new certreq.ini request.csr`

3. Open the request.csr file in Notepad and copy the CSR content which is to the following format:

    ```
    -----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
    MIID8TCCAtkCAQAwbTEMMAoGA1UEBhMDVVNBMQswCQYDVQQIDAJXQTEQMA4GA1UE

## Create a Trusted Certificate Profile

The PKCS Certificates deployed for Intune managed devices must be chained with a Trusted Root Certificate. This requires you to create an Intune Trusted Certificate Profile with the root certificate obtained from the Symantec CA.

1. Get a Trusted Root Certificate from the Symantec CA:

    a. Logon to Symantec CA Admin portal.

    b. Click Manage CAs from Tasks:

    c. Select the appropriate CA from CAs list.

    d. Click Download root certificate to download the Trusted Root Certificate.

2. Create a Trusted Certificate Profile in the Intune administration portal:

    a. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using Intune tenant admin credentials and search for Intune resources.

    b. Create a Trusted Certificate profile from **Microsoft Intune** > **Device Configuration** - **Profiles** > **Create profile**

    c. Provide the required information in **Name** and **Description** fields then select the target platform. 

    d. Select the Trusted certificate profile from the Profile type drop down list.

    e. Upload the Trusted Root Certificate that you obtained from Symantec CA in the previous step.

    f. Complete the remaining steps in the profile creation. 

    g. Click **Assignments** and select the appropriate group.  At least one user or device must be part of the assigned group.

## Get the Certificate Profile OID

The Certificate Profile OID is associated with a Certificate Profile template in the Symantec CA.  To create a PKCS Certificate profile in the Intune administration portal, the certificate template name must be provided in the form of a Certificate Profile OID which is associated with a Certificate template in the Symantec CA.

1. Login to the Symantec CA Admin portal.
2. Click Manage Certificate Profiles.
3. Select the Certificate Profile that you want to use.
4. Copy the Certificate Profile OID. It looks similar to the following example:

   ```
   Certificate Profile OID = 2.16.840.1.113733.1.16.1.2.3.1.1.47196109 
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If there are any issues obtaining the Certificate Profile OID, contact Symantec Customer Support.

## Create a PKCS Certificate Profile

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using your Intune tenant administrator credentials and search for Intune resources.
2. Create a PKCS Certificate profile from **Microsoft Intune** > **Device Configuration – Profiles** > **Create profile** > **PKCS Certificate**.

    a. Provide the required information in the **Name** and **Description** fields then select the target platform.

    b. Select the **PKCS certificate profile** from the **Profile type** drop down list.  

    c. Complete the remaining steps to create the profile.

   ![ConfigureProfile][ConfigureProfile]

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The following parameters of the PKCS Certificate Profile must be configured with specified values in the following table as shown in screen shot to issue PKCS Certificates through Intune Certificate Connector from Symantec CA. 

    |PKCS Certificate Parameter | Value | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Certificate authority | pki-ws.symauth.com | This value must be Symantec CA base service FQDN without trailing slashes.  If you are not sure whether this is the correct base service FQDN for your Symantec CA subscription, contact Symantec Customer support. <br><br> If this FQDN is incorrect, Intune Certificate Connector won't issue PKCS Certificates from the Symantec CA.| 
    | Certificate authority name | Symantec | This value must be the string **Symantec**. <br><br> If there is any change to this value, Intune Certificate Connector won't issue PKCS Certificates from the Symantec CA.|
    | Certificate template name | Certificate Profile OID from Symantec CA. <br><br> Ex: `2.16.840.1.113733.1.16.1.2.3.1.1.61904612`| This value must be a Certificate Profile OID obtained in the previous section from the Symantec CA Certificate Profile template. <br><br> If Intune Certificate Connector cannot find a certificate template associated with this Certificate Profile OID in the Symantec CA, it won't issue PKCS certificates from the Symantec CA.|

   > [!NOTE]
   > The PKCS Certificate profiles for Windows platforms doesn’t need to associate with a Trusted Certificate profile. But it is required for non-Windows platform profiles such as Android.

3. Click **Assignments** and select the appropriate group.  At least one user or device must be part of the assigned group.
 
After completing the previous steps, Intune Certificate Connector will issue PKCS Certificates from the Symantec CA to Intune managed devices in the assigned group. These certificates will be available in the Personal store of the Current User certificate store on the Intune managed device.

### PKCS Certificate Profile supported attributes

|Attribute | Intune Supported formats | Symantec Cloud CA Supported formats | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Subject Name |Intune supports the subject name in following three formats only: <br><br> 1. Common Name <br> 2. Common Name includes email <br> 3. Common Name as email <br><br> The following is an example: <br><br> `CN = IWUser0 <br><br> E = IWUser0@samplendes.onmicrosoft.com` | Symantec CA supports additional attributes.  If you want to select additional attributes, they must be defined with fixed values in the Symantec Certificate Profile template.| We use Common Name or email from the PKCS Certificate request. <br><br> Any mismatch in attributes selection between the Intune Certificate Profile and the Symantec Certificate Profile template results in no certificates issued from the Symantec CA.|
| SAN | Intune supports only the following SAN field values: <br><br> AltNameTypeEmail <br><br> AltNameTypeUpn <br><br> AltNameTypeOtherName (encoded value) | The Symantec Cloud CA also supports these parameters. If you want to select additional attributes, they must be defined with fixed values in the Symantec Certificate Profile template. <br><br> AltNameTypeEmail: If this type is not found in SAN, it uses the value from AltNameTypeUpn.  If AltNameTypeUpn is also not found in SAN then it uses the value from Subject Name if it’s in email format.  If still not found, Intune Certificate Connector fails to issue the certificates. <br><br> Ex: `RFC822 Name=IWUser0@ndesvenkatb.onmicrosoft.com`  <br><br> AltNameTypeUpn: If this type is not found in SAN, it uses the value from AltNameTypeEmail. If AltNameTypeEmail is also not found in SAN then uses the value from Subject Name if it’s in email format.  If still not found, Intune Certificate Connector fails to issue the certificates.  <br><br> Ex: `Other Name: Principal Name=IWUser0@ndesvenkatb.onmicrosoft.com` <br><br> AltNameTypeOtherName: If this type is not found in SAN, Intune Certificate Connector fails to issue the certificates. <br><br> Ex: `Other Name: DS Object Guid=04 12 b8 ba 65 41 f2 d4 07 41 a9 f7 47 08 f3 e4 28 5c ef 2c` <br><br>  **Important Note:** The value of this field is supported only in encoded format (hexadecimal value) by the Symantec CA. So, for any value in this field, Intune Certificate Connector converts it to base 64 encoded before it submits the certificate request. **Intune Certificate Connector doesn’t validate whether this value is already encoded or not.** | None |

## Troubleshooting

Intune Certificate Connector Service logs are available in `%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Intune\NDESConnectorSvc\Logs\Logs` on the NDES Connector machine. Open the logs in the [SvcTraceViewer](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wcf/service-trace-viewer-tool-svctraceviewer-exe) and search for exception or error messages.

Restart the Intune Connector Service. <br><br> If the issue persists, contact Symantec customer support. |
| Symantec Provider - Failed to get client certificate | Intune Certificate Connector failed to retrieve the Resource Authorization Certificate from Local Machine-Personal certificate store. To resolve this issue, make sure to install the Resource Authorization Certificate in the Local Machine-Personal certificate store along with its private key. <br><br> **Note:** The Resource Authorization certificate must be obtained from the Symantec CA. For more details, contact Symantec customer support. | 
| Symantec Provider - Failed to get Symantec policy “The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.” | This error occurs under the following scenarios: <br><br> 1. Intune Certificate Connector service doesn’t have enough permissions to read the Resource Authorization certificate along with its private key from the Local Machine-Personal certificate store. To resolve this issue, check the Connector service running context account in services.msc. The Connector service must run under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context. <br><br> 2. The PKCS Certificate profile in the Intune admin portal may be configured with an invalid Symantec CA base service FQDN. The FQDN is similar to `pki-ws.symauth.com`. To resolve this issue, check with Symantec customer support whether the URL is correct for your subscription. <br><br> 3. Intune Certificate Connector fails to authenticate with Symantec CA using the Resource Authorization certificate because it is to unable to retrieve its private key. To resolve this issue, make sure to install the Resource Authorization certificate along with its private key in the Local Machine-Personal certificate store. <br><br> If the issue persists, contact Symantec customer support. |
| Symantec Provider - Failed to get Symantec policy “A request element is not understood.” | Intune Certificate Connector failed to get the Symantec Certificate Profile template, because the Client Profile OID does not match the Intune Certificate Profile. In another case, Intune Certificate Connector is unable to find the certificate profile template that is associated with the given Client Profile OID in Symantec CA. <br><br> To resolve this issue, make sure to obtain the correct Client Profile OID from the Symantec Certificate template in the Symantec CA. Then update the PKCS Certificate profile in the Intune admin portal. <br><br> Obtain Client Profile OID from Symantec CA: <br> 1. Log on to Symantec CA admin portal. <br> 2. Click on Manage Certificate Profiles <br> 3. Select the Certificate Profile that you intend to use. <br> 4. Obtain the Certificate Profile OID. It looks similar to the following example: <br> `Certificate Profile OID = 2.16.840.1.113733.1.16.1.2.3.1.1.47196109` <br><br> Update the PKCS Certificate profile with correct Certificate Profile OID: <br>1. Log on to Intune admin portal <br> 2. Go to the PKCS Certificate Profile and click **Edit**. <br> 3. Update the Certificate Profile OID in update in Certificate Template name field. <br> 4. Save the PKCS Certificate Profile. |
| Symantec Provider - Policy Verification failed. <br><br> Attribute does not fall under Symantec supported Certificate template attributes list | The Symantec CA shows this message when there is discrepancy between the Symantec Certificate Profile template and the Intune Certificate Profile. This issue likely happened due to attribute mismatch in SubjectName or SubjectAltName. <br><br> To resolve this issue, make sure to select Intune supported attributes for SubjectName and SubjectAltName in the Symantec Certificate Profile template. For more information, see the Intune Supported attributes in the Certificate Parameters section. |
| Some User devices are not receiving PKCS certificates from Symantec CA. | This issue happens when User UPN contains special characters like underscore (Example: `global_admin@intune.onmicrosoft.com`). <br><br> The Symantec CA doesn’t support special characters in mail_firstname and mail_lastname. <br><br> The following steps help resolve this issue: <br><br> 1.   Log on to Symantec CA admin portal. <br> 2. Goto the Manage Certificate Profiles. <br> 3.   Click the Certificate Profile used for Intune. <br> 4.  Click the Customize options link. <br> 5.   Click the Advanced options button. <br> 6.  Under Certificate fields – Subject DN, add Common Name (CN) field and delete existing Common Name (CN) field. Add and delete must be performed together. <br> 7.    Click Save. <br><br> With the preceding change, the Symantec Certificate profile requests “CN=<upn>” instead of mail_firstname and mail_lastname. |
| User manually deleted already deployed certificate from the device. | Intune redeploys the same certificate during next check-in or policy enforcement. In this case, NDES Connector doesn’t receive a PKCS Certificate request. |
