# Sync devices with Intune to get the latest policies and actions


[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

The **Sync** device action forces the selected device to immediately check in with Intune. When a device checks in, it immediately receives any pending actions or policies that have been assigned to it.  This action can help you to immediately validate and troubleshoot policies you’ve assigned, without waiting for the next scheduled check-in.

## Supported platforms

- Windows
- Windows Phone
- iOS
- macOS
- Android

## How to sync a device

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
2. Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.
3. On the **Intune** blade, choose **Devices**.
4. On the **Devices and groups** blade, choose **All devices**.
5. From the list of devices you manage, choose a device, and then choose the **Sync** remote action.
7. Choose **Yes** to confirm the action.


## Retriable error codes

When an administrator runs the **Sync** device action, iOS and Androids apps that failed but  raised a retriable error code will be available to the device. However, apps that raised a non-retriable error code must wait for seven days before they can be made available to the device.
