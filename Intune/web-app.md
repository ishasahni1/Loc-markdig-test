# How to add web apps to Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Before you can manage and assign an app for your users, you must add the app to Intune. Intune supports a variety of app types including web apps.

> [!Note]
> Web apps are not supported on Android for Work devices.

The following procedure will allow you to add an app to Intune as a shortcut to an app on the web:

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
2. Using **More resources**, search for and select **Intune**.
3. On the **Microsoft Intune** blade, select **Mobile apps**.
4. On the **Mobile apps** blade, select **Apps**.
5. Above the list of apps, select **Add**. The **Add app** blade will be displayed.
6. In the **Add app** blade, select the **Web app** type from the **App type** drop-down list.
7. Select the **Configure** option to display the **App information** blade.
8. In the **App information** blade, add the following information:
	- **Name** - Enter the name of the app as it will be displayed in the company portal.
	- **Description** - Enter a description for the app. This will be displayed to end users in the company portal.
	- **Publisher** - Enter the name of the publisher of this app.
	- **App URL** - Enter the URL of the web site that hosts the app you want to assign.
	- **Category (optional)** - Select one or more of the built-in app categories, or a category you created. This will make it easier for users to find the app when they browse the company portal.
	- **Display this as a featured app in the Company Portal** - Display the app prominently on the main page of the company portal when users browse for apps.
	- **Require a managed browser to open this link** - When you assign a link to a website or web app to users, they will be able to open it only in the Intune managed browser. This browser must be installed on their device.
	- **Logo** - Upload an logo that will be associated with the app. This is the logo that will be displayed with the app when users browse the company portal.
9. When you are done, on the **Add information** blade, select **Ok**.
10. Then, from the **Add app** blade, select **Add**.

The app you have created will be displayed in the apps list where you can assign it to the groups you choose. For help, see [How to assign apps to groups](apps-deploy.md).
