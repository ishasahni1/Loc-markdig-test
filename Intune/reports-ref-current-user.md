# Reference for Current User entity

The **Current User** category contains user properties in the data model. The **Current User** entity collection is limited to currently active users. The entity contains all the Azure Active Directory users that are currently assigned a license. The license could be an Intune license, a Hybrid license, or a Microsoft Office 365 license. If a user has been removed, they will not be represented in the Current User collection. For a collection that contains a history of changes in user state, see [Reference for user entity](reports-ref-user.md).


## Current User

The **Current User** entity lists all the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users with assigned licenses in your enterprise.
