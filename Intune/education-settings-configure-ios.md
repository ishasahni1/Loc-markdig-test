# How to configure Intune settings for the iOS Classroom app

[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

## Introduction
[Classroom](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1085319084) is an app that helps teachers to guide learning, and control student devices in the classroom. For example, using the app, a teacher can:

- Open apps on student devices
- Lock, and unlock the iPad screen
- View the screen of a student iPad
- Navigate students iPads to a bookmark, or chapter in a book
- Display the screen from a student iPad on an Apple TV

Use the Intune iOS **Education** device profile, and the information in this topic to help you set up the Classroom app, and the devices on which you use it.

## Before you start

Consider the following before you begin to configure these settings:

- Both teachers and student iPads must be enrolled in Intune
- Ensure that you have installed the [Apple Classroom](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/classroom/id1085319084?mt=8) app on the teacherâ€™s device. You can either install the app manually, or use [Intune app management](app-management.md).
- You must configure certificates to authenticate connections between teacher and student devices (see Step 2)
- Teacher and student iPads must be on the same Wi-Fi network, and also have Bluetooth enabled
- The Classroom app runs on supervised iPads running iOS 9.3 or later
- In this release, Intune supports managing a 1:1 scenario where each student has their own dedicated iPad


## Step 1 - Import your school data into Azure Active Directory

Use Microsoft's School Data Sync (SDS) to import school records from an existing Student Information System (SIS) to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
SDS synchronizes information from your SIS and stores it in Azure AD. Azure AD is a Microsoft management system that helps you organize users and devices. You can then use this data to help you manage your students and classes. [Learn more about how to deploy SDS](https://support.office.com/article/Overview-of-School-Data-Sync-and-Classroom-f3d1147b-4ade-4905-8518-508e729f2e91).

### How to import data using SDS

You can import information into SDS by using one of the following methods:

- [CSV files](https://support.office.com/article/Follow-these-steps-71d5fe4a-aa51-4f35-9b53-348898a390a1) - Manually export and compile comma-separated value (.csv) files
- [PowerSchool API](https://support.office.com/article/Follow-these-steps-851b5edc-558f-43a9-9122-b2d63458cb8f) - An SIS provider that simplifies syncing with Azure AD
- [Clever API](https://support.office.com/article/Follow-these-steps-f3d92fde-3ad0-48f3-80a1-1ad0ac4a3fae) - An identity management solution that syncs directly with Azure AD
- [OneRoster](https://support.office.com/article/Follow-these-steps-f43cbb2a-b502-497d-a8b1-783dc05a57ab) - A CSV format that you can export and convert to sync with Azure AD

## Step 2 - Create and assign an iOS Education profile in Intune

### Configure general settings

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
2. Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.
3.	On the **Intune** blade, choose **Configure devices**.
4.	On the **Device Configuration** blade, choose **Manage** > **Profiles**.
5.	On the profiles blade, choose **Create Profile**.
6.	On the **Create Profile** blade, enter a **Name** and **Description** for the iOS education profile.
7.	From the **Platform** drop-down list, choose **iOS**.
8.	From the **Profile type** drop-down list, choose **Education**.
9.	Choose **Settings** > **Configure**.


Next, you need certificates to establish a trust relationship between teacher and student iPads. Certificates are used to seamlessly and silently authenticate connections between devices without having to enter user names and passwords.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The teacher and student certificates you use must be issued by different certification authorities (CAs). You must create two new subordinate CAs connected to your existing certificate infrastructure; one for teachers, and one for students.

iOS education profiles support only PFX certificates. SCEP certificates are not supported.

Certificates you create must support server authentication in addition to user authentication.

### Configure teacher certificates

On the **Education** blade, choose **Teacher certificates**.

#### Configure teacher root certificate

Under **Teacher root certificate**, choose the browse button to select the teacher root certificate with the extension .cer (DER, or Base64 encoded), or .P7B (with or without full chain).

#### Configure teacher PKCS#12 certificate

Under **Teacher PKCS#12 certificate**, configure the following values:

- **Subject name format** - Intune automatically prefixes the certificate common name with **leader**, for the teacher certificate, and **member**, for the student certificate.
- **Certification authority** - An Enterprise Certification Authority (CA) that runs on an Enterprise edition of Windows Server 2008 R2 or later. A Standalone CA is not supported. 
- **Certification authority name** - Enter the name of your certification authority.
- **Certificate template name** - Enter the name of a certificate template that has been added to an issuing CA. 
- **Renewal threshold (%)** - Specify the percentage of the certificate lifetime that remains before the device requests renewal of the certificate.
- **Certificate validity period** - Specify the amount of remaining time before the certificate expires.
You can specify a value that is lower than the validity period in the specified certificate template, but not higher. For example, if the certificate validity period in the certificate template is two years, you can specify a value of one year but not a value of five years. The value must also be lower than the remaining validity period of the issuing CA certificate.

When you have finished configuring certificates, choose **OK**.

### Configure student certificates

1.	On the **Education** blade, choose **Student certificates**.
2.	On the **Student certificates** blade, from the **Student device certificates** type list, choose **1:1**.

#### Configure student root certificate

Under **Student root certificate**, choose the browse button to select the student root certificate with the extension .cer (DER, or Base64 encoded), or .P7B (with or without full chain).

#### Configure student PKCS#12 certificate

Under **Student PKCS#12 certificate**, configure the following values:

- **Subject name format** - Intune automatically prefixes the certificate common name with **leader**, for the teacher certificate, and **member**, for the student certificate.
- **Certification authority** - An Enterprise Certification Authority (CA) that runs on an Enterprise edition of Windows Server 2008 R2 or later. A Standalone CA is not supported. 
- **Certification authority name** - Enter the name of your certification authority.
- **Certificate template name** - Enter the name of a certificate template that has been added to an issuing CA. 
- **Renewal threshold (%)** - Specify the percentage of the certificate lifetime that remains before the device requests renewal of the certificate.
- **Certificate validity period** - Specify the amount of remaining time before the certificate expires.
You can specify a value that is lower than the validity period in the specified certificate template, but not higher. For example, if the certificate validity period in the certificate template is two years, you can specify a value of one year but not a value of five years. The value must also be lower than the remaining validity period of the issuing CA certificate.

When you are finished configuring certificates, choose **OK**.

## Finish up

1.	On the **Education** blade, choose OK.
2.	On the **Create Profile** blade, choose **Create**.
	
The profile is created and appears on the profiles list blade.

Assign the profile to student devices in the classroom groups that were created when you synchronized your school data with Azure AD (see [How to assign device profiles](device-profile-assign.md).

## Next steps

Now, when a teacher uses the Classroom app, they will have full control over student devices.

For more information about the Classroom app, see [Classroom help](https://help.apple.com/classroom/ipad/2.0/), on the Apple web site.
