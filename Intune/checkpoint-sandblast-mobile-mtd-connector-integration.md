# Integrate Check Point SandBlast Mobile with Intune

## Before you begin

> [!NOTE] 
> The steps below need to be taken in the [Check Point SandBlast Mobile MTD console](https://intune-4.eu1.locsec.net/).

Before starting the process of integrating Check Point SandBlast Mobile with Intune, make sure you have the following:

-   Microsoft Intune subscription

-   Azure Active Directory admin credentials to grant the following permissions:

    -   Sign in and read user profile

    -   Access the directory as the signed-in user

    -   Read directory data

    -   Send device information to Intune

-   Admin credentials to access Check Point SandBlast Mobile MTD console.

### Check Point SandBlast app authorization

The Check Point SandBlast app authorization process consists of the following:

-   Allow the Check Point SandBlast Mobile service to communicate information related to device health state back to Intune.

-   CheckPoint SandBlast Mobile syncs with Azure AD Enrollment Group membership to populate its deviceâ€™s database.

-   Allow Check Point SandBlast admin console to use Azure AD Single Sign On (SSO).

-   Allow the Check Point SandBlast Mobile app to sign in using Azure AD SSO.

## To set up Check Point SandBlast Mobile integration

1.  Go to [Check Point SandBlast Mobile MTD console](https://intune-4.eu1.locsec.net/) and sign in with your credentials.

2.  Click on the **Settings** tab.
