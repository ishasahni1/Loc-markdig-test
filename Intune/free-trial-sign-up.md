# Sign up for a Microsoft Intune free trial


This article walks you through signing up for a trial of Intune standalone for the Azure portal.

1. Visit the [Intune Sign up](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=40BE278A-DFD1-470a-9EF7-9F2596EA7FF9&dl=INTUNE_A&ali=1#0%20) page and fill out the form to sign up for a trial subscription.
2. If you have a work or school account and want to use that for your Intune trial, follow [these sign-in instructions](/intune/account-sign-up) instead.

* If most of your IT operations and users are in a different locale than you, you may want to select that locale under **Where's your company located?**.

2. At the end of the sign-up process, you get a message with your new account information. <br/> ![Image of account  information](./media/2-end-of-sign-up-process.png) <br/>At this point, if you click **You're ready to go**, you are taken to the Office 365 Admin Center, where you can add users to your test environment. <br/><br/>However, if you want to go directly into the Intune Azure portal, open a new browser window, and enter **https://portal.azure.com** in the address bar. You are taken to the Azure sign-in page where you can use the credentials you were given to sign in. Use this address whenever you want to sign into your Intune trial. <br/> ![Image of Azure portal sign-in page](./media/azure-portal-signin.png)

The first time you sign on to the Intune Azure portal, you may not see Intune on your Azure dashboard. To add the Intune service to your Azure dashboard:
1. Choose **More services >** in the list of Azure services to the left of the dashboard, and enter **Intune** in the search box.
2. Choose **Intune** from the list, and select the star to add the service to the list of services.<br/> ![Image of selecting Intune from services list](./media/azure-add-intune1.png)
3. Then choose **Intune** in the list of services to open the Intune dashboard.

When you sign up for a trial, you will also receive an email message that contains your account information at the email address that you provided during the sign-up process. This email confirms your trial is active.



## Keeping the admin experiences straight


There are three portals you use for the Intune Azure portal:
- The Intune dashboard in Azure ([portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)) where you can explore the [capabilities of Intune in the Azure portal](what-is-intune.md).
- The Office 365 Admin center ([portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com)) where you can add and manage users if you are not using Azure Active Directory for that. You can also manage other aspects of your account, including billing and support.
- The Intune admin console ([manage.microsoft.com](https://manage.microsoft.com)) where you can explore features that have not yet been added to Azure.

Normally, youâ€™ll do your work in the Intune dashboard, shown below. This is the site where you set up and manage your groups, policies, devices, and apps.

You can go to the Intune admin console from the dashboard by choosing **Classic portal** at the top of your dashboard.

To return to the Intune Azure portal, enter https://portal.azure.com in your browser address bar and then choose **Intune** again from the services list.

You use the Office 365 Admin center, shown below, to add and manage your users and other aspects of your account, including billing and support.

To go from the Office 365 Admin center to the Intune dashboard, enter https://portal.azure.com in your browser address bar. Choose **Intune** in the services list.

To get from Intune back to the Office 365 Admin center, enter https://portal.office.com in your browser address bar. If you are already logged into Intune, you will be taken directly to the Office 365 Admin Center.
