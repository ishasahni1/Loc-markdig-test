# What are Microsoft Intune device profiles?

[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Use the Microsoft Intune **Device configuration** workload to manage settings and features on all of the devices you manage. You mostly use this workload to create device profiles, which let you manage and control a whole range of different features and functionality on devices.

When you open this workload, you see the following options:

- **Overview** - This page gives you status and reports that help you monitor device configurations that you have assigned to users and devices.
- **Manage Profiles** - This section is where you go to create device configuration profiles. You can find a list all the profile types you can create later in this topic.
- **Setup Certificate Authority** - This workflow walks you though the steps required to configure Intune certificate profiles.

## Getting started

The workflow for creating device profiles is similar for all profiles. Read [How to create Microsoft Intune device configuration profiles](device-profile-create.md) for information. Then read on for specific information about creating settings for each profile type.

You can manage the following capabilities on your devices:

## Device features

Device features let you control features on iOS and macOS devices like AirPrint, notifications, and shared device configurations.
For more information, see [How to configure device feature settings](device-features-configure.md)
Supports: iOS and macOS.

## Device restrictions
Device restrictions let you control many settings on devices you manage across categories including security, hardware, and data sharing settings. For example, you could create a device restriction profile that prevents users of iOS devices from accessing the device camera.
For more information, see [How to configure device restriction settings](device-restrictions-configure.md)
Supports: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows 10, and Windows 10 Team.

## Email
Email profiles let you create, assign, and monitor Exchange ActiveSync email settings on devices you manage. Email profiles help ensure consistency, reduce support calls, and let end-users access company email on their personal devices without any required setup on their part.
For more information, see [How to configure email settings](email-settings-configure.md)
Supports: Android, iOS, Windows Phone 8.1, and Windows 10.

## Wi-Fi
Use Wi-Fi profiles to assign wireless network settings to users and devices in your organization. When you assign a Wi-Fi profile, your users get access to your corporate Wi-Fi without having to configure it themselves.
For more information, see [How to configure Wi-Fi settings](wi-fi-settings-configure.md)
Supports: Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows 8.1 (import only).

## VPN
Virtual private networks (VPNs) give your users secure remote access to your company network. Devices use a VPN connection profile to initiate a connection with the VPN server. Assign VPN profiles to users and devices in your organization, so they can easily and securely connect to the network.
For more information, see [How to configure VPN settings](vpn-settings-configure.md).
Supports: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows Phone 8.1, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10.

## Education
Lets you configure options for the Windows Take a Test app. When you configure these options, no other apps can run on the device until the test is complete.
For more information, see [How to configure education settings](education-settings-configure.md)

## Certificates
This profile type lets you configure trusted, SCEP, and PKCS certificates that can be assigned to devices and used to authenticate Wi-Fi, VPN, and email profiles.
For more information, see [How to configure certificates](certificates-configure.md)
Supports: Android, iOS, Windows Phone 8.1, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10.

## Edition upgrade
This profile type lets you automatically upgrade devices that run some versions of Windows 10 to a newer edition.
For more information, see [How to configure Windows 10 edition upgrades](edition-upgrade-configure-windows-10.md)
Supports: Windows 10 only.

## Endpoint protection
This profile type lets you configure BitLocker and Windows Defender settings for Windows 10 devices.
For more information, see [Endpoint protection settings for Windows 10](endpoint-protection-windows-10.md)
Supports: Windows 10 only.

## Windows Information Protection
Windows Information Protection helps to protect against data leakage without otherwise interfering with the employee experience. It also helps to protect enterprise apps and data against accidental data leaks on enterprise-owned devices and personal devices that employees bring to work without requiring changes to your environment or other apps.
For more information, see [How to configure Windows Information Protection](windows-information-protection-configure.md)
Supports: Windows 10 only.

## Custom
Custom settings let you assign device settings that are not built-into Intune. For example, on Android devices, you can specify OMA-URI values that configure the device. For iOS devices, you can import a configuration file you created in the Apple Configurator.
For more information, see [How to configure custom settings](custom-settings-configure.md)
Supports: Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows Phone 8.1.

## Next steps
Choose one of the profile types from the list to get started configuring devices.
