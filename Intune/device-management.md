# What is Microsoft Intune device management?


[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

As an IT admin, you must ensure that managed devices are providing the resources your end users need to do their work while protecting that data from risk.

The **Devices** workload gives you insights into the devices you manage, and lets you perform remote tasks on those devices. To access the workload:

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
2. Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.
3. In **Intune**, choose **Devices**.
4. You can view information about devices and perform the remote device actions as follows:
	- **Overview** - A snapshot of the enrolled devices you can manage.
	- **All devices** - A list of the enrolled devices you manage. Choose **Filter** or **Columns** to refine the information displayed. Select a device to [view device inventory](device-inventory.md).
	- **Azure AD devices** - A list of the devices registered or joined with Azure Active Directory (AD). Learn more about [Azure AD device management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/device-management-introduction).
	- **Device actions** - A history of the remote actions performed on devices including the action, its status, who initiated the action, and the time.

	- **TeamViewer** - TeamViewer service allows users of Intune-managed Android devices to get remote assistance from their IT administrator. Learn more about [TeamViewer](device-profile-android-teamviewer.md).
