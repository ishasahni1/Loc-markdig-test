# Add and assign Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) apps with Intune

> [!NOTE] 
> This topic applies to all Mobile Threat Defense partners.

You can use Intune to add and deploy MTD apps so end-users can receive notifications when a threat is identified in their mobile devices, and to receive guidance to remediate the threats.

For iOS devices, you need the [Microsoft Authenticator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/multi-factor-authentication/end-user/microsoft-authenticator-app-how-to) so users can have their identities checked by Azure AD. Additionally, you need the iOS app configuration policy which signals the MTD iOS app to use with Intune.

> [!TIP]
> The Intune company portal works as the broker on Android devices so users can have their identities checked by Azure AD.

## Before you begin

-   The below steps need to be completed in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

-   Make sure youâ€™re familiar with the process of:

    -   [Adding an app into Intune](apps-add.md).

    -   [Adding an iOS app configuration policy into Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/configure-ios-apps-with-mobile-app-configuration-policies-in-microsoft-intune).

    -   [Assigning an app with Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/deploy-apps-in-microsoft-intune).

    -   [ Adding an iOS app configuration policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/configure-ios-apps-with-mobile-app-configuration-policies-in-microsoft-intune).

## To add apps

### All MTD partners

#### Microsoft Authenticator app for iOS

- See the instructions for [adding iOS store apps to Microsoft Intune](store-apps-ios.md). Use this [Microsoft Authenticator app store URL](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458?mt=8) on **step 5** under the **Configure app information** section.

### Lookout

#### Android
- See the instructions for [adding Android store apps to Microsoft Intune](store-apps-android.md). Use this [Lookout for work Google app store URL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lookout.enterprise) on **step 7**.

#### iOS

- See the instructions for [adding iOS store apps to Microsoft Intune](store-apps-ios.md). Use this [Lookout for Work iOS app store URL](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lookout-for-work/id997193468?mt=8) on **step 5** under the **Configure app information** section.

#### Lookout for Work app outside the Apple store

You need to re-sign the Lookout for Work iOS app. Lookout distributes its Lookout for Work iOS app outside of the iOS App Store. Before distributing the app, you must re-sign the app with your iOS Enterprise Developer Certificate.

For detailed instructions to re-sign the Lookout for Work iOS apps, see [Lookout for Work iOS app re-signing process](https://personal.support.lookout.com/hc/articles/114094038714) on the Lookout website.

##### Enable Azure AD authentication for Lookout for Work iOS app

Enable Azure Active Directory authentication for the iOS users by doing the following:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.sazure.com), sign in with your credentials, then navigate to the application page.
  
2. Add the **Lookout for Work iOS app** as a **native client application**.

3. Replace the **com.lookout.enterprise.yourcompanyname** with the customer bundle ID you selected when you signed the IPA.

4.  Add additional redirect URI: **&lt;companyportal://code/>** followed by a URL encoded version of your original redirect URI.

5.  Add **Delegated Permissions** to your app.

	> [!NOTE] 
	> See [configure a native client application with Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-how-to-configure-active-directory-authentication/#optional-configure-a-native-client-application) for more details.

##### Add the Lookout for Work ipa file

- Upload the re-signed .ipa file as described in the [Add iOS LOB apps with Intune](lob-apps-ios.md) topic. You also need to set the minimum OS version to iOS 8.0 or later.

### Skycure

#### Android

- See the instructions for [adding Android store apps to Microsoft Intune](store-apps-android.md). Use this [Skycure app store URL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skycure.skycure) on **step 7**.

#### iOS

- See the instructions for [adding iOS store apps to Microsoft Intune](store-apps-ios.md). Use this [Skycure app store URL](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skycure/id695620821?mt=8) on **step 5** under the **Configure app information** section.

### Check Point SandBlast Mobile

#### Android

- See the instructions for [adding Android store apps to Microsoft Intune](store-apps-android.md). Use this [Check Point SandBlast Mobile app store URL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lacoon.security.fox) on **step 7**.

#### iOS

- Contact [Check Point SandBlast Mobile](https://www.checkpoint.com/products/sandblast-mobile/) to get the iOS app. See the instructions for [adding iOS store apps to Microsoft Intune](store-apps-ios.md), then use the Apple store URL on **step 5** under the **Configure app information** section.

### Zimperium

#### Android

- See the instructions for [adding Android store apps to Microsoft Intune](store-apps-android.md). Use this [Zimperium app store URL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zimperium.zips&hl=en) on **step 7**.

#### iOS

## To associate the MTD app with an iOS app configuration policy

### For Lookout

- Create the iOS app configuration policy as described in the [using iOS app configuration policy](app-configuration-policies-use-ios.md) topic.

### For Skycure

-   Use the same Azure AD account previously configured in the [Skycure Management console](https://aad.skycure.com), which should be the same account used to log in to the Intune classic portal.

-   You need to **download** the iOS app configuration policy file: 
	-   Go to [Skycure Management console](https://aad.skycure.com) and sign in with your admin credentials.
	
	-   Go to **Settings** &gt; **Device Management Integrations** &gt; **EMM Integration Selection**, choose **Microsoft Intune**, then save your selection.
	
	-   Click on the **Integration setup files** link and save the generated \*.zip file. The .zip file contains the **skycure\_configuration.plist** file, which will be used to create the iOS app configuration policy in Intune.
	
	-   See the instructions for [using Microsoft Intune app configuration policies for iOS](app-configuration-policies-use-ios.md) to add the Skycure iOS app configuration policy.
	
	- On **step 8**, use the option **Enter XML data**, copy the content from the **skycure_configuration.plist** file and paste its content into the configuration policy body.

You can also copy the **skycure_configuration.plist** content from here:

```
<dict>
	<key>MdmType</key>
	<string>Intune</string>
	<key>UserEmail</key>
	<string>{{userprincipalname}}</string>
</dict>

```

	- On **step 8**, use the option **Enter XML data**, copy the content below and paste it into the configuration policy body.

```
<dict><key>MDM</key><string>INTUNE</string></dict>

```

### For Zimperium

- See the instructions for [using Microsoft Intune app configuration policies for iOS](app-configuration-policies-use-ios.md) to add the Zimperium iOS app configuration policy.
	- On **step 8**, use the option **Enter XML data**, copy the content below and paste it into the configuration policy body.

```
<dict>
<key>provider</key><string>Intune</string>
