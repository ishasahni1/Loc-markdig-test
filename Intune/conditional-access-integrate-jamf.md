If your organization uses [Jamf Pro](https://www.jamf.com) to manage your end users' Macs, you can use Microsoft Intune compliance policies with Azure Active Directory conditional access to ensure that devices in your organization are compliant.

## Prerequisites

You need the following to configure conditional access with Jamf Pro:

- Access to the Intune Private Preview for macOS conditional access
- Jamf Pro 10.1.0 or later
- [Company Portal app for macOS](https://aka.ms/macoscompanyportal)
- macOS devices with OS X 10.11 Yosemite or later

## Connecting Intune to Jamf Pro

You can connect Intune with Jamf Pro by:

1. Creating a new application in Azure
2. Enabling Intune to integrate with Jamf Pro
3. Configure conditional access in Jamf Pro

## Create a new application in Azure Active Directory

1. Open **Azure Active Directory** > **App Registrations**.
2. Click **+New application registration**.
3. Enter a **display name**, such as **Jamf Conditional Access**.
4. Select **Web app / API**.
5. Specify the **Sign-On URL** using your Jamf Pro instance URL.
6. Click **Create application**.
7. Save the newly-created **Application ID**, then open **Settings** and navigate to **API Access** > **Keys** to create a new Application Key. Enter a **Description**, how long to wait before it **Expires**, then save the Application Key.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The Application Key is only shown once during this process. Be sure to save it somewhere where you can easily retrieve it.

8. Open **Settings**, then navigate to **API Access** > **Required Permissions** and delete all permissions.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Add a new required permission. The application can have only work properly if it has the single required permission.

9.  Select **Microsoft Intune API** and click **Select**.
10. Choose **Send device attributes to Microsoft Intune** and click **Select**.
11. Click the **Grant Permissions** button after saving the required permissions for the application.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the Application Key expires, you must create a new Application Key in Microsoft Azure and then update the Conditional Access data in Jamf Pro. Azure allows you to have both the old key and new key active to prevent service disruptions.

## Enable Intune to integrate with Jamf Pro

1. In the Microsoft Azure portal, open **Microsoft Intune** > **Device Compliance** > **Partner device management**.
2. Enable the Compliance Connector for Jamf by pasting the Application ID into the **Jamf Azure Active Directory App ID** field.
3. Click **Save**.

## Configure Microsoft Intune Integration in Jamf Pro

1. In Jamf Pro, navigate to **Global Management** > **Conditional Access**. Click the **Edit** button on the
**Microsoft Intune Integration** tab.
2. Select the checkbox for **Enable Microsoft Intune Integration**.
3. Provide the required information about your Azure tenant, including **Location**, **Domain name**, and the **Application ID** and **Application Key** you saved from the previous steps.
4. Click **Save**. Jamf Pro will test your settings and verify your success.

## Set up compliance policies and register devices

After you finish configuring integration between Intune and Jamf, you need to [apply compliance policies to Jamf-managed devices](conditional-access-assign-jamf.md).

## Information shared from Jamf Pro to Intune

* OS Version

* Password: number of previous passwords to prevent reuse
* System Integrity Protection
* Last Check-In Time
