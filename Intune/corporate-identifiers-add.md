# Identify devices as corporate-owned

[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

As an Intune admin, you can identify devices as corporate-owned to refine management and identification. Intune can perform additional management tasks and collect additional information such as the full phone number and an inventory of apps from corporate-owned devices. You can also set device restrictions to block enrollment by devices that aren't corporate-owned.

A device is identified as corporate-owned if any of the following conditions are true:

- Enrolled with a [device enrollment manager](device-enrollment-manager-enroll.md) account (all platforms)
- Enrolled with the Apple [Device Enrollment Program](device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md), [Apple School Manager](apple-school-manager-set-up-ios.md), or [Apple Configurator](apple-configurator-enroll-ios.md) (iOS only)
- [Identified as corporate-owned before enrollment](#identify-corporate-owned-devices-with-imei-or-serial-number) with an international mobile equipment identifier (IMEI) numbers (all platforms with IMEI numbers) or serial number (iOS and Android)
- Registered in Azure Active Directory or Enterprise Mobility + Security as a Windows 10 Enterprise device
- The device's properties list [device ownership as corporate](#change-device-ownership)

## Identify corporate-owned devices with IMEI or serial number

As an Intune admin, you can create and import a comma-separated value (.csv) file that lists IMEI numbers or serial numbers. Intune uses these identifiers to specify device ownership as corporate during device enrollment. You can declare IMEI numbers for all supported platforms. You can only declare serial number for iOS, macOS, and Android devices. Each IMEI or serial number can have details specified in the list for administrative purposes.

<!-- When you upload serial numbers for company-owned iOS devices, they must be paired with a corporate enrollment profile. Devices must then be enrolled using either Apple’s device enrollment program (DEP) or Apple Configurator to have them appear as company-owned. -->

## Add corporate identifiers
To create the list, create a two-column, comma-separated value (.csv) list without a header. Add the IMEI or serial numbers in the left column, and the details in the right column. Only one type of ID, IMEI or serial number, can be imported in a single .csv file. Details are limited to 128 characters and are for administrative use only. Details aren't displayed on the device. The current limit is 5,000 rows per .csv file.

**Upload a .csv file that has serial numbers** – Create a two-column, comma-separated value (.csv) list without a header, and limit the list to 5,000 devices or 5 MB per .csv file.

|||
|-|-|
|&lt;ID #1&gt;|&lt;Device #1 Details&gt;|
|&lt;ID #2&gt;|&lt;Device #2 Details&gt;|

This .csv file when viewed in a text editor appears as:

```
01234567890123,device details
02234567890123,device details
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some Android devices have multiple IMEI numbers. Intune only reads one IMEI number per enrolled device. If you import an IMEI number but it is not the IMEI inventoried by Intune, the device is classified as a personal device instead of a company-owned device. If you import multiple IMEI numbers for a device, uninventoried numbers display **Unknown** for enrollment status.<br>
>Also note:
>Android Serial numbers are not guaranteed to be unique or present. Check with your device supplier to understand if serial number is a reliable device ID.
>Serial numbers reported by the device to Intune might not match the displayed ID in the Android Settings/About menus on the device. Verify the type of serial number reported by the device manufacturer.

### Add a .csv list of corporate identifiers

1. In Intune in the Azure portal, choose **Device enrollment** > **Corporate Device Identifiers**, and then click **Add**.

 ![Screenshot of the corporate device identifier workspace with the Add button highlighted.](./media/add-corp-id.png)

2. In the **Add Identifiers** blade, specify the identifier type: **IMEI** or **Serial**. You can specify whether previously imported numbers should **Overwrite details for existing identifiers**.

3. Click the folder icon and specify the path to the list you want to import. Navigate to the .csv file, and select **Add**. You can click **Refresh** to see new device identifiers.

Imported devices are not necessarily enrolled. Devices can have a state of either **Enrolled** or **Not contacted**. **Not contacted** means that the device has never communicated in with the Intune service.

### Delete corporate identifiers

1. In Intune in the Azure portal, choose **Device enrollment** > **Corporate Device Identifiers**.
2. Select the device identifiers you want to delete, and choose **Delete**.
3. Confirm the deletion.

Deleting a corporate identifier for an enrolled device does not change the device's ownership. To change a device's ownership, go **Devices** > **All devices**, select the device, choose **Properties**, and change **Device ownership**.

### IMEI specifications
For detailed specifications about International Mobile Equipment Identifiers, see [3GGPP TS 23.003](https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=729).

## Change device ownership

Devices properties display **Ownership** for each device records in Intune. As an admin, you can specify devices as **Personal** or **Corporate**.

**To change device ownership:**
1. In Intune in the Azure portal, go **Devices** > **All devices**, and choose the device.
3. Choose **Properties**.
4. Specify **Device ownership** as **Personal** or **Corporate**.
