The issuance of certificates is provided through a SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Point) server. The values in The entity indicate various states that a device could be in as it goes through this process. Some of these states include WorkPlace join failing due to the issuance of a required certificate (from a SCEP server) failing.
