# Microsoft Intune App SDK for Android developer guide

> [!NOTE]
> You might want to first read the [Intune App SDK overview](app-sdk.md), which covers the current features of the SDK and describes how to prepare for integration on each supported platform.

The Microsoft Intune App SDK for Android lets you incorporate Intune app protection policies (also known as **APP** or MAM policies) into your native Android app. An Intune-enlightened application is one that is integrated with the Intune App SDK. Intune administrators can easily deploy app protection policies to your Intune-enlightened app when Intune actively manages the app.


## What's in the SDK

The Intune App SDK consists of the following files:  

* **Microsoft.Intune.MAM.SDK.aar**: The SDK components, with the exception of the Support.V4 and Support.V7 JAR files. This file can be used in place of the individual components if your build system supports AAR files.
* **Microsoft.Intune.MAM.SDK.Support.v4.jar**: The interfaces necessary to enable MAM in apps that use the Android v4 support library. Apps that need this support must reference the JAR file directly.
* **Microsoft.Intune.MAM.SDK.Support.v7.jar**: The interfaces necessary to enable MAM in apps that use the Android v7 support library. Apps that need this support must reference the JAR file directly.
* **Microsoft.Intune.MDM.SDK.DownlevelStubs.jar**: This jar contains
  stubs for Android system classes which are present only on newer
  devices but which are referenced by methods in MAMActivity. Newer
  devices will ignore these stub classes. This jar is necessary only
  if your app performs reflection on classes deriving from
  MAMActivity, and most apps do not need to include it. If you use
  this jar, you must be careful to exclude all its classes from
  ProGuard. They will all be under the "android" root package
* **proguard.txt**: Contains ProGuard rules which must be applied if building with ProGuard.
* **CHANGELOG.txt**: Provides a record of changes made in each SDK version.
* **THIRDPARTYNOTICES.TXT**:  An attribution notice that acknowledges third-party and/or OSS code that will be compiled into your app.

If your build system does not support AAR files, you may use the following files in place of Microsoft.Intune.MAM.SDK.aar.
* **Microsoft.Intune.MAM.SDK.jar**: The interfaces necessary to enable MAM and interoperability with the Intune Company Portal app. Apps must specify it as an Android library reference.
* **The res directory**: The resources (like strings) on which the SDK relies.
* **AndroidManifest.xml**: Entry points and the library requirements.


## Requirements

The Intune App SDK is a compiled Android project. As a result, it is largely unaffected by the version of Android that the app uses for its minimum or target API versions. The SDK supports Android API 19 (Android 4.4+) through Android API 26 (Android 8.0).


### Company Portal app
The Intune App SDK for Android relies on the presence of the [Company Portal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal) app on the device to enable app protection policies. The Company Portal retrieves app protection policies from the Intune service. When the app initializes, it loads policy and code to enforce that policy from the Company Portal.

> [!NOTE]
> When the Company Portal app is not on the device, an Intune-enlightened app behaves the same as a normal app that does not support Intune app protection policies.

For app protection without device enrollment, the user is _**not**_ required to enroll the device by using the Company Portal app.

## SDK Integration

### Build integration

The Intune App SDK is a standard Android library with no external dependencies. **Microsoft.Intune.MAM.SDK.jar** contains both the interfaces necessary for an app protection policy enablement and the code necessary to interoperate with the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app.

**Microsoft.Intune.MAM.SDK.jar** must be specified as an Android library reference. To do this, open your app project in Android Studio and go to **File > New > New module** and select **Import .JAR/.AAR Package**. Select our Android archive package Microsoft.Intune.MAM.SDK.aar.

Additionally, **Microsoft.Intune.MAM.SDK.Support.v4** and **Microsoft.Intune.MAM.SDK.Support.v7** contain Intune variants of `android.support.v4` and `android.support.v7` respectively. They are not built into Microsoft.Intune.MAM.SDK.aar in case an app does not want to include the support libraries. They are standard JAR files instead of Android library projects.

#### ProGuard

If [ProGuard](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/) (or any other shrinking/obfuscation mechanism) is used as a build step, Intune SDK classes must be excluded. For ProGuard, this can be accomplished by including the rules from the proguard.txt file distributed with the SDK.

The Azure Active Directory Authentication Libraries (ADAL) may have its own ProGuard restrictions. If your app integrates ADAL, you must follow the ADAL documentation on these restrictions.

### Entry points

The Azure Active Directory Authentication Library ([ADAL](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-authentication-libraries/)) requires these permissions to perform brokered authentication. If these permissions are not granted to the app or are revoked by the user, authentication flows that require the broker (the Company Portal app) will be disabled.

The Intune App SDK requires changes to an app's source code to enable Intune app protection policies. This is done through the replacement of the Android base classes with equivalent Intune base classes, whose names have the prefix **MAM**. The SDK classes live between the Android base class and the app's own derived version of that class. Using an activity as an example, you end up with an inheritance hierarchy that looks like: `Activity` > `MAMActivity` > `AppSpecificActivity`.

For example, when `AppSpecificActivity` interacts with its parent (for example, calling `super.onCreate()`), `MAMActivity` is the super class.

Typical Android apps have a single mode and can access the system 
through their 
[**Context**](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html) object. Apps 
that have integrated the Intune App SDK, on the other hand, have dual 
modes. These apps continue to access the system through the `Context` 
object. Depending on the base `Activity` used, the `Context` object 
will be provided by Android or will intelligently multiplex between a 
restricted view of the system and the Android-provided
 `Context`. After you derive from one of the MAM entry points, it's safe 
to use `Context` as you would normally -- for example, starting `Activity` classes and using `PackageManager`.


## Replace classes, methods, and activities with their MAM equivalent

Android base classes must be replaced with their respective MAM equivalents. To do so, find all instances of the classes listed in the following table and replace them with the Intune App SDK equivalent. Most of these are classes which your app classes will inherit from, but some (e.g. MediaPlayer) will be classes your app uses without deriving.

| Android base class | Intune App SDK replacement |
|--|--|
| android.app.Activity | MAMActivity |
| android.app.ActivityGroup | MAMActivityGroup |
| android.app.AliasActivity | MAMAliasActivity |
| android.app.Application | MAMApplication |
| android.app.DialogFragment | MAMDialogFragment |
| android.app.ExpandableListActivity | MAMExpandableListActivity |
| android.app.Fragment | MAMFragment |
| android.app.IntentService | MAMIntentService |
| android.app.LauncherActivity | MAMLauncherActivity |
| android.app.ListActivity | MAMListActivity |
| android.app.NativeActivity | MAMNativeActivity |
| android.app.PendingIntent | MAMPendingIntent (see [Pending Intent](#pendingintent)) |
| android.app.Service | MAMService |
| android.app.TabActivity | MAMTabActivity |
| android.app.TaskStackBuilder | MAMTaskStackBuilder |
| android.app.backup.BackupAgent | MAMBackupAgent |
| android.app.backup.BackupAgentHelper | MAMBackupAgentHelper |
| android.app.backup.FileBackupHelper | MAMFileBackupHelper |
| android.app.backup.SharePreferencesBackupHelper | MAMSharedPreferencesBackupHelper |
| android.content.BroadcastReceiver | MAMBroadcastReceiver |
| android.content.ContentProvider | MAMContentProvider |
| android.os.Binder | MAMBinder (Only necessary if the Binder is not generated from an Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL) interface) |
| android.media.MediaPlayer | MAMMediaPlayer |
| android.media.MediaMetadataRetriever | MAMMediaMetadataRetriever |
| android.provider.DocumentsProvider | MAMDocumentsProvider |
| android.preference.PreferenceActivity | MAMPreferenceActivity |

> [!NOTE]
> Even if your application does not have a need for its own derived `Application` class, [see `MAMApplication` below](#mamapplication)

### Microsoft.Intune.MAM.SDK.Support.v4.jar:

| Android Class Intune MAM | Intune App SDK replacement |
|--|--|
| android.support.v4.app.DialogFragment | MAMDialogFragment
| android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity | MAMFragmentActivity
| android.support.v4.app.Fragment | MAMFragment
| android.support.v4.app.JobIntentService | MAMJobIntentService
| android.support.v4.app.TaskStackBuilder | MAMTaskStackBuilder
| android.support.v4.content.FileProvider | MAMFileProvider

### Microsoft.Intune.MAM.SDK.Support.v7.jar:

|Android Class | Intune App SDK replacement |
|--|--|
|android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity | MAMAppCompatActivity |

### Renamed Methods


In many cases, a method available in the Android class has been marked as final in the MAM replacement class. In this case, the MAM replacement class provides a similarly named method (generally suffixed with `MAM`) that you should override instead. For example, when deriving from `MAMActivity`, instead of overriding `onCreate()` and calling `super.onCreate()`, `Activity` must override `onMAMCreate()` and call `super.onMAMCreate()`. The Java compiler should enforce the final restrictions to prevent accidental override of the original method instead of the MAM equivalent.

### MAMApplication
Due to constraints within the MAM SDK, you **must** create a subclass of `com.microsoft.intune.mam.client.app.MAMApplication` and set it as the name of the `Application` class used in your manifest. `MAMApplication` is abstract and requires an override for `byte[] getADALSecretKey`, please see the Javadoc on that function for more information about how to implement it.
### PendingIntent
Instead of `PendingIntent.get*`, you must use the `MAMPendingIntent.get*` method. After this, you can use the resultant `PendingIntent` as usual.

### Manifest Replacements
Please note that it may be necessary to perform some of the above class replacements in the manifest as well as in Java code. Of special note:
* Manifest references to `android.support.v4.content.FileProvider` must be replaced with `com.microsoft.intune.mam.client.support.v4.content.MAMFileProvider`.
* If your application does not have a need for its own derived Application class, `com.microsoft.intune.mam.client.app.MAMApplication` must be set as the name of the Application class used in the manifest.

## SDK permissions

The Intune App SDK requires three [Android system permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html) on apps that integrate it:

* `android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS`  (requested at runtime if required)

* `android.permission.MANAGE_ACCOUNTS`

* `android.permission.USE_CREDENTIALS`

The Azure Active Directory Authentication Library ([ADAL](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-authentication-libraries/)) requires these permissions to perform brokered authentication. If these permissions are not granted to the app or are revoked by the user, authentication flows that require the broker (the Company Portal app) will be disabled.

## Logging

Logging should be initialized early to get the most value out of logged data. `Application.onMAMCreate()` is typically the best place to initialize logging.

To receive MAM logs in your app, create a [Java Handler](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/Handler.html) and add it to the `MAMLogHandlerWrapper`. This will invoke `publish()` on the application handler for every log message.

```java
/**
 * Global log handler that enables fine grained PII filtering within MAM logs.  
 *
 * To start using this you should build your own log handler and add it via
 * MAMComponents.get(MAMLogHandlerWrapper.class).addHandler(myHandler, false);  
 *
 * You may also remove the handler entirely via
 * MAMComponents.get(MAMLogHandlerWrapper.class).removeHandler(myHandler);
 */
public interface MAMLogHandlerWrapper {
    /**
     * Add a handler, PII can be toggled.
     *
     * @param handler handler to add.
     * @param wantsPII if PII is desired in the logs.    
     */
    void addHandler(final Handler handler, final boolean wantsPII);

    /**
     * Remove a handler.
     *
     * @param handler handler to remove.
     */
    void removeHandler(final Handler handler);
}
```



## Enable features that require app participation

There are several app protection policies the SDK cannot implement on its own. The app can control its behavior to achieve these features by using several APIs that you can find in the following `AppPolicy` interface. To retrieve an `AppPolicy` instance, use `MAMPolicyManager.getPolicy`.

```java
/**
 * External facing application policies.
 */
public interface AppPolicy {

/**
 * Restrict where an app can save personal data.
 * This function is now deprecated. Please use getIsSaveToLocationAllowed(SaveLocation, String) instead
 * @return True if the app is allowed to save to personal data stores; false otherwise.
 */
@Deprecated
boolean getIsSaveToPersonalAllowed();

/**
 * Check if policy prohibits saving to a content provider location.
 *
 * @param location
 *            a content URI to check
 * @return True if location is not a content URI or if policy does not prohibit saving to the content location.
 */
boolean getIsSaveToLocationAllowed(Uri location);

/**
 * Determines if the SaveLocation passed in can be saved to by the username associated with the cloud service.
 *
 * @param service
 *           see {@link SaveLocation}.
 * @param username
 *           the username/email associated with the cloud service being saved to. Use null if a mapping between
 *           the AAD username and the cloud service username does not exist or the username is not known.
 * @return true if the location can be saved to by the identity, false if otherwise.
 */
boolean getIsSaveToLocationAllowed(SaveLocation service, String username);

/**
 * Whether the SDK PIN prompt is enabled for the app.
 *
 * @return True if the PIN is enabled. False otherwise.
 */
boolean getIsPinRequired();

/**
 * Whether the Intune Managed Browser is required to open web links.
 * @return True if the Managed Browser is required, false otherwise
 */
boolean getIsManagedBrowserRequired();

/**
 * Check if policy allows Contact sync to local contact list.
 *
 * @return True if Contact sync is allowed to save to local contact list; false otherwise.
 */
boolean getIsContactSyncAllowed();

/**
 * This method is intended for diagnostic/telemetry purposes only. It can be used to discover whether
 * file encryption is in use. File encryption is transparent to the app, and the app should not need
 * to make any business logic decisions based on this.
 * 
 * @return True if file encryption is in use.
 */
boolean diagnosticIsFileEncryptionInUse();

/**
 * Return the policy in string format to the app.
 *  
 * @return The string representing the policy.
 */
String toString();

}
```

> [!NOTE]
> `MAMPolicyManager.getPolicy` will always return a non-null App Policy, even if the device or app is not under an Intune management policy.

### Example: Determine if PIN is required for the app

If the app has its own PIN user experience, you might want to disable it if the IT administrator has configured the SDK to prompt for an app PIN. To determine if the IT administrator has deployed the app PIN policy to this app, for the current end user, call the following method:

```java

MAMPolicyManager.getPolicy(currentActivity).getIsPinRequired();
```

### Example: Determine the primary Intune user

In addition to the APIs exposed in AppPolicy, the user principal name (**UPN**) is also exposed by the `getPrimaryUser()` API defined inside the `MAMUserInfo` interface. To get the UPN, call the following:

```java
MAMUserInfo info = MAMComponents.get(MAMUserInfo.class);
if (info != null) return info.getPrimaryUser();
```

The full definition of the MAMUserInfo interface is below:

```java
/**
 * External facing user informations.
 *
 */
public interface MAMUserInfo {
       /**
        * Get the primary user name.
        *
        * @return the primary user name or null if the device is not enrolled.
        */
       String getPrimaryUser();
}
```

### Example: Determine if saving to device or cloud storage is permitted

Many apps implement features that allow the end user to save files locally or to a cloud storage service. The Intune App SDK allows IT administrators to protect against data leakage by applying policy restrictions as they see fit in their organization.  One of the policies that IT can control is whether the end user can save to a "personal," unmanaged data store. This includes saving to a local location, SD card, or third-party backup services.

**App participation is needed to enable the feature.** If your app allows saving to personal or cloud locations directly from the app, you must implement this feature to ensure that the IT administrator can control whether saving to a location is allowed. The API below lets the app know whether saving to a personal store is allowed by the current Intune administrator's policy. The app can then enforce the policy, since it is aware of personal data store available to the end user through the app.  

To determine if the policy is enforced, make the following call:

```java
MAMPolicyManager.getPolicy(currentActivity).getIsSaveToLocationAllowed(
SaveLocation service, String username);
``````

... where `service` is one of the following SaveLocations:


    * SaveLocation.ONEDRIVE_FOR_BUSINESS
    * SaveLocation.LOCAL
    * SaveLocation.SHAREPOINT

The previous method of determining whether a user’s policy allowed them to save data to various locations was `getIsSaveToPersonalAllowed()` within the same **AppPolicy** class. This function is now **deprecated** and should not be used, the following invocation is equivalent to `getIsSaveToPersonalAllowed()`:

```java

MAMPolicyManager.getPolicy(currentActivity).getIsSaveToLocationAllowed(SaveLocation.LOCAL, userNameInQuestion);
```

>[!NOTE]
> Use `SaveLocation.OTHER` if the location in question is not listed in the **SaveLocations** enum.


## Register for notifications from the SDK

### Overview
The Intune App SDK allows your app to control the behavior of certain policies, such as selective wipe, when they are deployed by the IT administrator. When an IT administrator deploys such a policy, the Intune service sends down a notification to the SDK.

Your app must register for notifications from the SDK by creating a `MAMNotificationReceiver` and  registering it with `MAMNotificationReceiverRegistry`. This is done by providing the receiver and the type of notification desired in  `App.onCreate`, as the example below illustrates:

```java
@Override
public void onCreate() {
  super.onCreate();
  MAMComponents.get(MAMNotificationReceiverRegistry.class)
    .registerReceiver(
      new ToastNotificationReceiver(),
      MAMNotificationType.WIPE_USER_DATA);
  }
``````

### MAMNotificationReceiver

The `MAMNotificationReceiver` interface simply receives notifications from the Intune service. Some notifications are handled by the SDK directly, while others require the app's participation. An app **must** return either true or false from a notification. It must always return true unless some action it tried to take as a result of the notification failed.

* This failure may be reported to the Intune service. An example of a scenario to report is if the app fails to wipe user data after the IT administrator initiates a wipe.

>[!NOTE]
> It is safe to block in `MAMNotificationReceiver.onReceive` because its callback is not running on the UI thread.

The `MAMNotificationReceiver` interface as defined in the SDK is included below :

```java
/**
 * The SDK is signaling that a MAM event has occurred.
 *
 */
public interface MAMNotificationReceiver {

    /**
     * A notification was received.
     *
     * @param notification
     *            The notification that was received.
     * @return The receiver should return true if it handled the
     *   notification without error (or if it decided to ignore the
     *   notification). If the receiver tried to take some action in
     *   response to the notification but failed to complete that
     *   action it should return false.
     */
    boolean onReceive(MAMNotification notification);
}
```

### Types of notifications

The following notifications are sent to the app and some of them may require app participation:

* **WIPE_USER_DATA**: This notification is sent in a `MAMUserNotification` class. When this notification is received, the app is expected to delete all data associated with the "corporate" identity passed with the `MAMUserNotification`. This notification is currently sent during APP-WE service unenrollment. The user's primary name is typically specified during the enrollment process. If you register for this notification, your app must ensure that all the user's data has been deleted. If you don't register for it, the default selective wipe behavior will be performed.

* **WIPE_USER_AUXILIARY_DATA**: Apps can register for this notification if they'd like the Intune App SDK to perform the default selective wipe behavior, but would still like to remove some auxiliary data when the wipe occurs.

* **REFRESH_POLICY**: This notification is sent in a `MAMUserNotification`. When this notification is received, any cached Intune policy must be invalidated and updated. This is generally handled by the SDK; however, it should be handled by the app if the policy is used in any persistent way.

* **MANAGEMENT_REMOVED**: This notification is sent in a `MAMUserNotification` and informs
the app that it is about to become unmanaged. Once unmanaged, it will no longer be able to
read encrypted files, read data encrypted with MAMDataProtectionManager, interact with the
encrypted clipboard, or otherwise participate in the managed-app ecosystem.


> [!NOTE]
> An app should never register for both the `WIPE_USER_DATA` and `WIPE_USER_AUXILIARY_DATA` notifications.


## Configure Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL)

First, please read the ADAL integration guidelines found in the [ADAL repository on GitHub](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android).

The SDK relies on [ADAL](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-authentication-libraries/) for its [authentication](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-authentication-scenarios/) and conditional launch scenarios, which require apps to be configured with [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-whatis/). The configuration values are communicated to the SDK via AndroidManifest metadata.

To configure your app and enable proper authentication, add the following to the app node in AndroidManifest.xml. Some of these configurations are only required if your app uses ADAL for authentication in general; in that case, you will need the specific values your app uses to register itself with AAD. This is done to ensure that the end user does not get prompted for authentication twice, due to AAD recognizing two separate registration values: one from the app and one from the SDK.

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.microsoft.intune.mam.aad.Authority"
    android:value="https://AAD authority/" />
<meta-data
    android:name="com.microsoft.intune.mam.aad.ClientID"
    android:value="your-client-ID-GUID" />
<meta-data
    android:name="com.microsoft.intune.mam.aad.NonBrokerRedirectURI"
    android:value="your-redirect-URI" />
<meta-data
    android:name="com.microsoft.intune.mam.aad.SkipBroker"
    android:value="[true | false]" />
```

### ADAL metadata

* **Authority** is the current AAD authority in use. If present, you should use your own environment where AAD accounts have been configured. If this value is absent, an Intune default is used.

* **ClientID** is the AAD ClientID to be used. You should use your own app's ClientID if it is registered with Azure AD. If this value is absent, an Intune default is used.

* **NonBrokerRedirectURI** is the AAD redirect URI to use in broker-less cases. If none is specified, a default value of `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` is used. This default is suitable for most apps.

* **SkipBroker** is used in case the ClientID has not been configured to use the broker redirect URI. The default value is "false."
    * For apps that **do not integrate ADAL** and **do not want to participate in device-wide brokered authentication/SSO**, this should be set to "true." When this value is "true," the only redirect URI that will be used is NonBrokerRedirectURI.

    * For apps that do support device-wide SSO brokering, this should be "false." When the value is "false," the SDK will select a broker between the result of [`com.microsoft.aad.adal.AuthenticationContext.getRedirectUriForBroker()`](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android) and NonBrokerRedirectURI, based on the availability of the broker on the system. In general, the broker will be available from the Company Portal app or Azure Authenticator app.

### Common ADAL configurations

The following are common ways an app can be configured with ADAL. Find your app's configuration and make sure to set the ADAL metadata parameters (explained above) to the necessary values.

1. **App does not integrate ADAL:**

    | Required ADAL parameter | Value |
    |--|--|
    | Authority | Desired environment where AAD accounts have been configured |
    | SkipBroker | True |

2. **App integrates ADAL:**

    |Required ADAL parameter| Value |
    |--|--|
    | Authority | Desired environment where AAD accounts have been configured |
    | ClientID | The app's ClientID (generated by Azure AD when the app is registered) |
    | NonBrokerRedirectURI | A valid redirect URI for the app, or `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`by default. <br><br> Make sure to configure the value as an acceptable redirect URI for your app's ClientID.
    | SkipBroker | False |


3. **App integrates ADAL but does not support brokered authentication/device-wide SSO:**

    |Required ADAL parameter| Value |
    |--|--|
    | Authority | Desired environment where AAD accounts have been configured |
    | ClientID | The app's ClientID (generated by Azure AD when the app is registered) |
    | NonBrokerRedirectURI | A valid redirect URI for the app, or `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` by default. <br><br> Make sure to configure the value as an acceptable redirect URI for your app's ClientID.
    | SkipBroker | **True** |

## App protection policy without device enrollment

### Overview
Intune app protection policy without device enrollment, also known as APP-WE or MAM-WE, allows apps to be managed by Intune without the need for the device to be enrolled Intune MDM. APP-WE works with or without device enrollment. The Company Portal is still required to be installed on the device, but the user does not need to sign into the Company Portal and enroll the device.

> [!NOTE]
> All apps are required to support app protection policy without device enrollment.

### Workflow

When an app creates a new user account, it should register the account for management with the Intune App SDK. The SDK will handle the details of enrolling the app in the APP-WE service; if necessary, it will retry any enrollments at appropriate time intervals if failures occur.

The app can also query the Intune App SDK for the status of a registered user to determine if the user should be blocked from accessing corporate content. Multiple accounts may be registered for management, but currently only one account can be actively enrolled with the APP-WE service at a time. This means only one account on the app can receive app protection policy at a time.

The app is required to provide a callback to acquire the appropriate access token from the Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) on behalf of the SDK. It is assumed that the app already uses ADAL for user authentication and to acquire its own access tokens.

When the app removes an account completely, it should unregister that account to indicate that the app should no longer apply policy for that user. If the user was enrolled in the MAM service, the user will be unenrolled and the app will be wiped.


### Overview of app requirements

To implement APP-WE integration, your app must register the user account with the MAM SDK:

1. The app _must_ implement and register an instance of the `MAMServiceAuthenticationCallback` interface. The callback instance should be registered as early as possible in the app's lifecycle (typically in the `onMAMCreate()` method of the application class).

2. When a user account is created and the user successfully signs in with ADAL, the app _must_ call the `registerAccountForMAM()`.

3. When a user account is completely removed, the app should call `unregisterAccountForMAM()` to remove the account from Intune management.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a user signs out of the app temporarily, the app does not need to call `unregisterAccountForMAM()`. The call may initiate a wipe to completely remove corporate data for the user.


### MAMEnrollmentManager

All the necessary authentication and registration APIs can be found in the `MAMEnrollmentManager` interface. A reference to the `MAMEnrollmentManager` can be obtained as follows:

```java
MAMEnrollmentManager mgr = MAMComponents.get(MAMEnrollmentManager.class);

// make use of mgr
```

The `MAMEnrollmentManager` instance returned is guaranteed not to be null. The API methods fall into two categories: **authentication** and **account registration**.

> [!NOTE]
> `MAMEnrollmentManager` contains some API methods that will be deprecated soon. For clarity, only the relevant methods and result codes are shown in the code block below.

```java
package com.microsoft.intune.mam.policy;

public interface MAMEnrollmentManager {
    public enum Result {
        AUTHORIZATION_NEEDED,
        NOT_LICENSED,
        ENROLLMENT_SUCCEEDED,
        ENROLLMENT_FAILED,
        WRONG_USER,
        MDM_ENROLLED,

    //Authentication methods
    interface MAMServiceAuthenticationCallback {
        String acquireToken(String upn, String aadId, String resourceId);
    }
    void registerAuthenticationCallback(MAMServiceAuthenticationCallback callback);
    void updateToken(String upn, String aadId, String resourceId, String token);

    //Registration methods

```

### Account authentication

This section describes the authentication API methods in `MAMEnrollmentManager` and how to use them.

```java
interface MAMServiceAuthenticationCallback {
        String acquireToken(String upn, String aadId, String resourceId);
}
void registerAuthenticationCallback(MAMServiceAuthenticationCallback callback);
void updateToken(String upn, String aadId, String resourceId, String token);
```

1. The app must implement the `MAMServiceAuthenticationCallback` interface to allow the SDK to request an ADAL token for the given user and resource ID. The callback instance must be provided to the `MAMEnrollmentManager` by calling its `registerAuthenticationCallback()` method. A token may be needed very early in the app lifecycle for enrollment retries or app protection policy refresh check-ins, so the ideal place to register the callback is in the `onMAMCreate()` method of the app's `MAMApplication` subclass.

2. The `acquireToken()` method should acquire the access token for the requested resource ID for the given user. If it can't acquire the requested token, it should return null.

3. In case the app is unable to provide a token when the SDK calls `acquireToken()`  -- for example, if silent authentication fails and it is an inconvenient time to show a UI -- the app can provide a token at a later time by calling the `updateToken()` method. The same UPN, AAD ID, and resource ID that were requested by the prior call to `acquireToken()` must be passed to `updateToken()`, along with the token that was finally acquired. The app should call this method as soon as possible after returning null from the provided callback.

> [!NOTE]
> The SDK will call `acquireToken()` periodically to get the token, so calling `updateToken()` is not strictly required. However, it is recommended as it can help enrollments and app protection policy check-ins complete in a timely manner.


### Account registration

This section describes the account registration API methods in `MAMEnrollmentManager` and how to use them.

```java
void registerAccountForMAM(String upn, String aadId, String tenantId);
void unregisterAccountForMAM(String upn);
Result getRegisteredAccountStatus(String upn);
```

1. To register an account for management, the app should call `registerAccountForMAM()`. A user account is identified by both its UPN and its AAD user ID. The tenant ID is also required to associate enrollment data with the user's AAD tenant. The SDK may attempt to enroll the app for the given user in the MAM service; if enrollment fails, it will periodically retry enrollment until the account is unregistered. The retry period will typically be 12-24 hours. The SDK provides the status of enrollment attempts asynchronously via notifications.

2. Because AAD authentication is required, the best time to register the user account is after the user has signed into the app and is successfully authenticated using ADAL.
    * The user's AAD ID and tenant ID are returned from the ADAL authentication call as part of the [`AuthenticationResult`](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android) object. The tenant ID comes from the `AuthenticationResult.getTenantID()` method.
    * Information about the user is found in a sub-object of type `UserInfo` that comes from `AuthenticationResult.getUserInfo()`, and the AAD user ID is retrieved from that object by calling `UserInfo.getUserId()`.

3. To unregister an account from Intune management, the app should call `unregisterAccountForMAM()`. If the account has been successfully enrolled and is managed, the SDK will unenroll the account and wipe its data. Periodic enrollment retries for the account will be stopped. The SDK provides the status of unenrollment request asynchronously via notifications.

### Important implementation notes

#### Authentication

* When the app calls `registerAccountForMAM()`, it may receive a callback on its `MAMServiceAuthenticationCallback` interface shortly thereafter, on a different thread. Ideally, the app acquired its own token from ADAL prior to registering the account to expedite the acquisition of the **MAMService token**. IF the app returns a valid token from the callback, enrollment will proceed and the app will get the final result via a notification.

* If the app doesn't return a valid AAD token, the final result from the enrollment attempt will be `AUTHENTICATION_NEEDED`. If the app receives this Result via notification, it can expedite the enrollment process by acquiring the **MAMService token** and calling the `updateToken()` method to initiate the enrollment process again. This is _not_ a firm requirement, however, since the SDK retries enrollment periodically and invokes the callback to acquire the token.

* The app's registered `MAMServiceAuthenticationCallback` will also be called to acquire a token for periodic app protection policy refresh check-ins. If the app is unable to provide a token when requested, it will not get a notification, but it should attempt to acquire a token and call `updateToken()` at the next convenient time to expedite the check-in process. If a token is not provided, the callback will still be called at the next check-in attempt.

#### Registration

* For your convenience, the registration methods are idempotent; for example, `registerAccountForMAM()`will only register an account and attempt to enroll the app if the account is not already registered, and `unregisterAccountForMAM()` will only unregister an account if it is currently registered. Subsequent calls are no-ops, so there is no harm in calling these methods more than once. Additionally, correspondence between calls to these methods and notifications of results are not guaranteed: i.e. if `registerAccountForMAM` is called for an identity that is already registered, the notification may not be sent again for that identity. It is possible that notifications are sent that don't correspond to any calls to these methods, since the SDK may periodically try enrollments in the background, and unenrollments may be triggered by wipe requests received from the Intune service.

* The registration methods can be called for any number of different identities, but currently only one user account can become successfully enrolled. If multiple user accounts that are licensed for Intune and targeted by app protection policy are registered at or near the same time, there is no guarantee on which one will win the race.

* Finally, you can query the `MAMEnrollmentManager` to see if a particular account is registered and to get its current status using the `getRegisteredAccountStatus` method. If the provided account is not registered, this method will return **null**. If the account is registered, this method will return the account's status as one of the members of the `MAMEnrollmentManager.Result` enumeration.

### Result and status codes

When an account is first registered, it begins in the `PENDING` state, indicating that the initial MAM service enrollment attempt is incomplete. After the enrollment attempt finishes, a notification will be sent with one of the Result codes in the table below. In addition, the `getRegisteredAccountStatus()` method will return the account's status so the app can always determine if access to corporate content is blocked for that user. If the enrollment attempt fails, the account's status may change over time as the SDK retries enrollment in the background.

|Result code | Explanation |
| -- | -- |
|AUTHORIZATION_NEEDED | This result indicates that a token was not provided by the app’s registered `MAMServiceAuthenticationCallback` instance, or the provided token was invalid.  The app should acquire a valid token and call `updateToken()` if possible. |
| NOT_LICENSED | The user is not licensed for Intune, or the attempt to contact the Intune MAM service failed.  The app should continue in an unmanaged (normal) state and the user should not be blocked.  Enrollments will be retried periodically in case the user becomes licensed in the future. |
| ENROLLMENT_SUCCEEDED | The enrollment attempt succeeded, or the user is already enrolled.  In the case of a successful enrollment, a policy refresh notification will be sent before this notification.  Access to corporate data should be allowed. |
| ENROLLMENT_FAILED | The enrollment attempt failed.  Further details can be found in the device logs.  The app should not allow access to corporate in this state, since it was previously determined that the user is licensed for Intune.|
| WRONG_USER | Only one user per device can enroll an app with the MAM service.  In order to enroll successfully as a different user, all enrolled apps must be unenrolled first.  Otherwise, this app must enroll as the primary user.  This check happens after the license check, so the user should be blocked from accessing corporate data until the app is successfully enrolled.|
| UNENROLLMENT_SUCCEEDED | Unenrollment was successful.|
| UNENROLLMENT_FAILED | The unenrollment request failed.  Further details can be found in the device logs. |
| PENDING | The initial enrollment attempt for the user is in progress.  The app can block access to corporate data until the enrollment result is known, but is not required to do so. |
| COMPANY_PORTAL_REQUIRED | The user is licensed for Intune, but the app cannot be enrolled until the Company Portal app is installed on the device. The Intune App SDK will attempt to block access to the app for the given user and direct them to install the Company Portal app (see below for details). |


### Company Portal requirement prompt override (optional)

If the `COMPANY_PORTAL_REQUIRED` Result is received, the SDK will block use of activities that use the identity for which enrollment was requested. Instead, the SDK will cause those activities to display a prompt to download the Company Portal. If you want to prevent this behavior in your app, activities may implement `MAMActivity.onMAMCompanyPortalRequired`.

This method is called before the SDK displays its default blocking UI. If the app changes the activity identity or unregisters the user who attempted to enroll, the SDK will not block the activity. In this situation, it is up to the app to avoid leaking corporate data.

### Notifications

A new type of `MAMNotification` has been added in order to inform the app that the enrollment request has completed.  The `MAMEnrollmentNotification` will be received through the `MAMNotificationReceiver` interface as described in the [Register for notifications from the SDK](#register-for-notifications-from-the-sdk) section.

```java
public interface MAMEnrollmentNotification extends MAMUserNotification {
    MAMEnrollmentManager.Result getEnrollmentResult();
}
```

The `getEnrollmentResult()` method returns the result of the enrollment request.  Since `MAMEnrollmentNotification` extends `MAMUserNotification`, the identity of the user for whom the enrollment was attempted is also available. The app must implement the `MAMNotificationReceiver` interface to receive these notifications, detailed in the [Register for notifications from the SDK](#Register-for-notifications-from-the-SDK) section.

The registered user account's status may change when an enrollment notification is received, but it will not change in some cases (e.g. if `AUTHORIZATION_NEEDED` notification is received after a more informative result such as `WRONG_USER`, the more informative result will be maintained as the account's status)


## Protecting Backup data

As of Android Marshmallow (API 23), Android has two ways for an app to back up its data. Each option is available to your app and requires different steps to ensure that Intune data protection is correctly implemented. You can review the table below on corresponding actions required for correct data protection behavior.  You can read more about the backup methods in the [Android API guide](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.html).

### Auto Backup for Apps

Android began offering [automatic full backups](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup.html) to Google Drive for apps on Android Marshmallow devices, regardless of the app's target API. In your AndroidManifest.xml, if you explicitly set `android:allowBackup` to **false**, then your app will never be queued for backups by Android and "corporate" data will stay within the app. In this case, no further action is necessary.

However, by default the `android:allowBackup` attribute is set to true, even if `android:allowBackup` isn't specified in the manifest file. This means all app data is automatically backed up to the user's Google Drive account, a default behavior that poses a **data leak risk**. Therefore, the SDK requires the changes outlined below to ensure that data protection is applied.  It is important to follow the guidelines  below to protect customer data properly if you want your app to run on Android Marshmallow devices.  

Intune allows you to utilize all the [Auto Backup features](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup.html) available from Android, including the ability to define custom rules in XML, but you must follow the steps below to secure your data:

1. If your app does **not** use its own custom BackupAgent, use the default MAMBackupAgent to allow for automatic full backups that are Intune policy compliant. If you do this, you can ignore the `android:fullBackupOnly` manifest attribute, as it’s not applicable for our backup agent. Place the following in the app manifest:

    ```xml
   android:backupAgent="com.microsoft.intune.mam.client.app.backup.MAMDefaultBackupAgent"
    ```


2. **[Optional]** If you implemented an optional custom BackupAgent, you need to make sure to use MAMBackupAgent or MAMBackupAgentHelper. See the following sections. Consider switching to using Intune's **MAMDefaultFullBackupAgent** (described in step 1) which provides easy back up on Android M and above.

3. When you decide which type of full backup your app should receive (unfiltered, filtered, or none) you'll need to set the attribute `android:fullBackupContent`  to true, false, or an XML resource in your app.

4. Then, you _**must**_ copy whatever you put into `android:fullBackupContent` into a metadata tag named `com.microsoft.intune.mam.FullBackupContent` in the manifest.

    **Example 1**: If you want your app to have full backups without exclusions, set both the `android:fullBackupContent` attribute and `com.microsoft.intune.mam.FullBackupContent` metadata tag to **true**:

    ```xml
    android:fullBackupContent="true"
    ...
    <meta-data android:name="com.microsoft.intune.mam.FullBackupContent" android:value="true" />  
    ```

    **Example 2**: If you want your app to use its custom BackupAgent and opt out of full, Intune policy compliant, automatic backups, you must set the attribute and metadata tag to **false**:

    ```xml
    android:fullBackupContent="false"
    ...
    <meta-data android:name="com.microsoft.intune.mam.FullBackupContent" android:value="false" />  
    ```

    **Example 3**: If you want your app to have full backups according to your custom rules defined in an XML file, please set the attribute and metadata tag to the same XML resource:

    ```xml
    android:fullBackupContent="@xml/my_scheme"
    ...
    <meta-data android:name="com.microsoft.intune.mam.FullBackupContent" android:resource="@xml/my_scheme" />  
    ```


### Key/Value Backup

The [Key/Value Backup](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/keyvaluebackup.html) option is available to all APIs 8+ and uploads app data to the [Android Backup Service](https://developer.android.com/google/backup/index.html). The amount of data per user of your app is limited to 5MB. If you use Key/Value Backup, you must use a **BackupAgentHelper** or a **BackupAgent**.

### BackupAgentHelper

BackupAgentHelper is easier to implement than BackupAgent both in terms of native Android functionality and Intune MAM integration. BackupAgentHelper allows the developer to register entire files and shared preferences to a **FileBackupHelper** and **SharedPreferencesBackupHelper** (respectively) which are then added to the BackupAgentHelper upon creation. Follow the steps below to use a BackupAgentHelper with Intune MAM:

1. To utilize multi-identity backup with a BackupAgentHelper, follow the Android guide to [Extending BackupAgentHelper](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/keyvaluebackup.html#BackupAgentHelper).

2. Have your class extend the MAM equivalent of BackupAgentHelper, FileBackupHelper, and SharedPreferencesBackupHelper.

|Android class | MAM equivalent |
|--|--|
|BackupAgentHelper |MAMBackupAgentHelper |
|FileBackupHelper | MAMFileBackupHelper
|SharedPreferencesBackupHelper| MAMSharedPreferencesBackupHelper|

Following these guidelines will lead to a successful multi-identity backup and restore.

### BackupAgent

A BackupAgent allows you to be much more explicit about what data is backed up. Because the developer is fairly responsible for the implementation, there are more steps required to ensure appropriate data protection from Intune. Since most of the work is pushed onto you, the developer, Intune integration is slightly more involved.

**Integrate MAM:**

1. Please carefully read the Android guide for [Key/Value Backup](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/keyvaluebackup.html) and specifically [Extending BackupAgent](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/keyvaluebackup.html#BackupAgent) to ensure your BackupAgent implementation follows Android guidelines.

2. Have your class extend `MAMBackupAgent`.

**Multi-identity Backup:**

1. Before beginning your backup, check that the files or data buffers you plan to back up are indeed **permitted by the IT administrator to be backed up** in multi-identity scenarios. We provide you with the `isBackupAllowed` function in `MAMFileProtectionManager` and `MAMDataProtectionManager` to determine this. If the file or data buffer is not allowed to be backed up, then you should not continue including it in your backup.

2. At some point during your backup, if you want to back up the identities for the files you checked in step 1, you must call `backupMAMFileIdentity(BackupDataOutput data, File … files)` with the files from which you plan to extract data. This will automatically create new backup entities and write them to the `BackupDataOutput` for you. These entities will be automatically consumed upon restore.

**Multi-identity Restore:**

The Data Backup guide specifies a general algorithm for restoring your application’s data and provides a code sample in the [Extending BackupAgent](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/keyvaluebackup.html#BackupAgent) section. In order to have a successful multi-identity restore, you must follow the general structure provided in this code sample with special attention to the following:

1.  You must utilize a `while(data.readNextHeader())`* loop to go through the backup entities.

2.  You must call `data.skipEntityData()`* if `data.getKey()`* does not match the key you wrote in `onBackup`. Without performing this step, your restores may not succeed.

3.  Avoid returning while consuming backup entities in the `while(data.readNextHeader())`* construct, as the entities we automatically write will be lost.

* Where `data` is the local variable name for the **BackupDataInput** that is passed to your app upon restore.

## Multi-identity (optional)

### Overview
By default, the Intune App SDK will apply policy to the app as a whole. Multi-identity is an optional Intune app protection feature which can be enabled to allow policy to be applied on a per-identity level. This requires significantly more app participation than other app protection features.

The app *must* inform the SDK when it intends to change the active identity. In some cases, the SDK will also notify the app when an
identity change is required. In most cases, however, MAM cannot know what data is being displayed in the UI or used on a thread at a given time and relies on the app to set the correct identity in order to avoid data leak. In the sections that follow, some particular
scenarios which require app action will be called out.

> [!NOTE]
>  A lack of the correct app participation can result in data leaks and other security issues.

Once the user enrolls the device or the app, the SDK registers this identity and considers it the primary Intune managed identity. Other users in the app will be treated as unmanaged, with unrestricted policy settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, only one Intune managed identity is supported per device.

Note that an identity is simply defined as a string. Identities are **case-insensitive**, and requests to the SDK for an identity may not return the same casing that was originally used when setting the identity.

### Enabling Multi-identity

By default, all apps are considered to be single-identity apps. You can declare an app to be multi-identity aware by placing the following metadata in AndroidManifest.xml.

```xml
  <meta-data
    android:name="com.microsoft.intune.mam.MAMMultiIdentity"
    android:value="true" />
```

### Setting the Identity

Developers can set the identity of the app user on the following levels in descending priority:

  1. Thread level
  2. Context  (generally Activity) level
  3. Process level

An identity set at the thread level supersedes an identity set at the
Context level, which supersedes an identity set at the process
level. An identity set on a Context is only used in appropriate
associated scenarios. File IO operations, for example, do not have an
associated Context. Most commonly, apps will set the Context identity
on an Activity. An app *must* not display data for a managed identity
unless the Activity's identity is set to that same identity. In
general, the process-level identity is only useful if the app works
only with a single user at a time on all threads. Many apps may not
need to make use of it.

The following methods in `MAMPolicyManager` may be used to set the identity and retrieve the identity values previously set.

```java
  public static void setUIPolicyIdentity(final Context context, final String identity, final MAMSetUIIdentityCallback mamSetUIIdentityCallback);

  public static String getUIPolicyIdentity(final Context context);

  public static MAMIdentitySwitchResult setProcessIdentity(final String identity);

  public static String getProcessIdentity();

  public static MAMIdentitySwitchResult setCurrentThreadIdentity(final String identity);

  public static String getCurrentThreadIdentity();

/**
   * Get the current app policy. This does NOT take the UI (Context) identity into account.
   * If the current operation has any context (e.g. an Activity) associated with it, use the overload below.
   */
  public static AppPolicy getPolicy();

  /**
  * Get the current app policy. This DOES take the UI (Context) identity into account.
   * If the current operation has any context (e.g. an Activity) associated with it, use this function.
   */
  public static AppPolicy getPolicy(final Context context);


  public static AppPolicy getPolicyForIdentity(final String identity);

  public static boolean getIsIdentityManaged(final String identity);
  ```

>[!NOTE]
> You can clear the identity of the app by setting it to null.
>
> The empty string may be used as an identity that will never have app protection policy.

#### Results
All the methods used to set the identity report back result values via `MAMIdentitySwitchResult`. There are four values that can be returned:

| Return value | Scenario |
|--|--|
| SUCCEEDED | The identity change was successful. |
| NOT_ALLOWED | The identity change is not allowed. The identity change is not allowed. This occurs if an attempt is made to set the UI (Context) identity when a different identity is set on the current thread. |
| CANCELLED | The user cancelled the identity change, generally by pressing the back button on a PIN or authentication prompt. |
| FAILED | The identity change failed for an unspecified reason.|

The app *must* ensure that an identity switch is successful before
displaying or using corporate data. Currently, process and thread
identity switches will always succeed for a multi-identity-enabled
app, however we reserve the right to add failure conditions. The UI
identity switch may fail for invalid arguments, if it would conflict
with the thread identity, or if the user cancels out of conditional
launch requirements (e.g. presses the back button on the PIN screen).


In the case of setting a Context identity, the result is reported asynchronously. If the Context is an Activity, the SDK doesn't know if the identity change succeeded until after conditional launch is performed -- which may require the user to enter a PIN or corporate credentials. The app is expected to implement a `MAMSetUIIdentityCallback` to receive this result, you can pass null for this parameter.

```java
    public interface MAMSetUIIdentityCallback {
        void notifyIdentityResult(MAMIdentitySwitchResult identitySwitchResult);
  }
```

You can also set the identity of an activity directly through a method in `MAMActivity` instead of calling `MAMPolicyManager.setUIPolicyIdentity`. Use following method to do so:

```java
     public final void switchMAMIdentity(final String newIdentity);
```

You can also override a method in `MAMActivity` if you want the app to be notified of the result of attempts to change the identity of that activity.

``` java
    public void onSwitchMAMIdentityComplete(final MAMIdentitySwitchResult result);
```

>[!NOTE]
> Switching the identity may require recreating the activity. In this case, the `onSwitchMAMIdentityComplete` callback will be delivered to the new instance of the activity.


### Implicit Identity Changes

In addition to the app's ability to set the identity, a thread or a context's identity may change based on data ingress from another Intune-enlightened app that has app protection policy.

#### Examples

  1. If an activity is launched from an `Intent` sent by another MAM app, the activity’s identity will be set based on the effective identity in the other app at the point the `Intent` was sent.

  2.  For services, the thread identity will be set similarly for the duration of an `onStart` or `onBind` call. Calls into the `Binder` returned from `onBind` will also temporarily set the thread identity.

  3. Calls into a `ContentProvider` will similarly set the thread identity for their duration.


  In addition, user interaction with an activity may cause an implicit identity switch.

  **Example:** A user canceling out of an authorization prompt during `Resume` will result in an implicit switch to an empty identity.

  The app is given an opportunity to be made aware of these changes, and, if it must, the app can forbid them. `MAMService` and `MAMContentProvider` expose the following method that subclasses may override:

  ```java
  public void onMAMIdentitySwitchRequired(final String identity,
    final AppIdentitySwitchResultCallback callback);
  ```

  In the `MAMActivity` class , an additional parameter is present in the method:

  ```java
  public void onMAMIdentitySwitchRequired(final String identity,
    final AppIdentitySwitchReason reason,
    final AppIdentitySwitchResultCallback callback);
  ```

  * The `AppIdentitySwitchReason` captures the source of the implicit switch, and can accept the values `CREATE`, `RESUME_CANCELLED`, and `NEW_INTENT`.  The `RESUME_CANCELLED` reason is used when activity resume causes PIN, authentication, or other compliance UI to be displayed and the user attempts to cancel out of that UI, generally though use of the back button.


  * The `AppIdentitySwitchResultCallback` is as follows:

    ```java
    public interface AppIdentitySwitchResultCallback {
        /**
         * @param result
         *            whether the identity switch can proceed.
         */
        void reportIdentitySwitchResult(AppIdentitySwitchResult result);
    }
    ```

    Where ```AppIdentitySwitchResult``` is either SUCCESS or FAILURE.

The method `onMAMIdentitySwitchRequired` is called for all implicit identity changes except for those made through a Binder returned from `MAMService.onMAMBind`. The default implementations of `onMAMIdentitySwitchRequired` immediately call:

* `reportIdentitySwitchResult(FAILURE)` when the reason is RESUME_CANCELLED.

* `reportIdentitySwitchResult(SUCCESS)` in all other cases.

  It is not expected that most apps will need to block or delay an identity switch in a different manner, but if an app needs to do so, the following points must be considered:

  * If an identity switch is blocked, the result is the same as if `Receive` sharing settings had prohibited the data ingress.

  * If a Service is running on the main thread, `reportIdentitySwitchResult` **must** be called synchronously or the UI thread will hang.

  * For **Activity** creation, `onMAMIdentitySwitchRequired` will be called before `onMAMCreate`. If the app must show UI to determine whether to allow the identity switch, that UI must be shown using a *different* activity.

  * In an **Activity**, when a switch to the empty identity is requested with the reason as RESUME_CANCELLED, the app must modify the resumed activity to display data consistent with that identity switch.  If this is not possible, the app should refuse the switch, and the user will be asked again to comply with policy for the resuming identity (e.g. by being presented with the app PIN entry screen).

    > [!NOTE]
    > A multi-identity app will always receive incoming data from both managed and unmanaged apps. It is the responsibility of the app to treat data from managed identities in a managed manner.

  If a requested identity is managed (use `MAMPolicyManager.getIsIdentityManaged` to check), but the app is not able to use that account (e.g. because accounts, such as email accounts, must be set up in the app first) then the identity switch should be refused.

### Preserving Identity In Async Operations
It is common for operations on the UI thread to dispatch background tasks to another thread. A multi-identity app will want to make sure that these background tasks operate with the appropriate identity, which is often the same identity used by the activity which dispatched them. The MAM SDK provides `MAMAsyncTask` and `MAMIdentityExecutors` as a convenience to aid in preserving the identity.
#### MAMAsyncTask

To use `MAMAsyncTask`, simply inherit from it instead of AsyncTask and replace overrides of `doInBackground` and `onPreExecute` with `doInBackgroundMAM` and `onPreExecuteMAM` respectively. The `MAMAsyncTask` constructor takes an activity context. For example:

```java
  AsyncTask<Object, Object, Object> task = new MAMAsyncTask<Object, Object, Object>(thisActivity) {

    @Override
    protected Object doInBackgroundMAM(final Object[] params) {
        // Do operations.
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPreExecuteMAM() {
        // Do setup.
    };
```

### MAMIdentityExecutors
`MAMIdentityExecutors` allows you to wrap an existing `Executor` or `ExecutorService` instance as an identity-preserving `Executor`/`ExecutorService` with `wrapExecutor` and `wrapExecutorService` methods. For example

```java
  Executor wrappedExecutor = MAMIdentityExecutors.wrapExecutor(originalExecutor, activity);
  ExecutorService wrappedService = MAMIdentityExecutors.wrapExecutorService(originalExecutorService, activity);
```

  ### File Protection

  Every file has an identity associated with it at the time of creation, based on thread and process identity. This identity will be used for both file encryption and selective wipe. Only files whose identity is managed and has policy requiring encryption will be encrypted. The SDK's default selective functionality wipe will only wipe files associated with the managed identity for which a wipe has been requested. The app may query or change a file’s identity using the `MAMFileProtectionManager` class.

  ```java
    public final class MAMFileProtectionManager {
    /**
         * Protect a file. This will synchronously trigger whatever protection is required for the 
           file, and will tag the file for future protection changes.

         *
         * @param identity
         *            Identity to set.
         * @param file
         *            File to protect.
         * @throws IOException
         *             If the file cannot be changed.
         */
        public static void protect(final File file, final String identity) throws IOException;

        /**
        * Protect a file obtained from a content provider. This is intended to be used for

#### App Responsibility
MAM cannot automatically infer a relationship between files being read and
data being displayed in an `Activity`. Apps *must* set the UI identity
appropriately before displaying corporate data. This includes data
read from files. If a file comes from outside the app (either from a
`ContentProvider` or read from a publicly writable location), the app
*must* attempt to determine the file identity (using
`MAMFileProtectionManager.getProtectionInfo`) before displaying
information read from the file. If `getProtectionInfo` reports a
non-null, non-empty identity, the UI identity *must* be set to match
this identity (using `MAMActivity.switchMAMIdentity` or
`MAMPolicyManager.setUIPolicyIdentity`). If the identity switch fails,
data from the file *must not* be displayed.

An example flow might look something like the following:
  * User selects a document to open in the app
  * During the open flow, prior to reading data from disk, the app confirms the identity that should be used to display the content
    * MAMFileProtectionInfo info = MAMFileProtectionManager.getProtectionInfo(docPath)
    * if(info) 
        MAMPolicyManager.setUIPolicyIdentity(activity, info.getIdentity(), callback)
    * The app waits until a result is reported to callback
    * If the reported result is a failure, the app does not display the document.
  * The app opens and renders the file

## Offline Scenarios

File identity tagging is sensitive to offline mode. The following points should be taken into account:

  * If the Company Portal is not installed, files cannot be identity-tagged.

  * If the Company Portal is installed, but the app does not have Intune MAM policy, files cannot be reliably tagged with identity.

  * When file identity tagging becomes available, all previously created files are treated as personal/unmanaged (belonging to the empty-string identity) unless the app was previously installed as a single-identity managed app in which case they are treated as belonging to the enrolled user.

### Directory Protection

Directories may be protected using the same `protect` method used to protect files. Please note that directory protection applies recursively to all files and subdirectories contained in the directory, and to new files created within the directory. Because directory protection is applied recursively, the `protect` call can take some time to complete for very large directories. For that reason, apps applying protection to a directory that contains a large number of files might wish to run `protect` asynchronously on a background thread.

### Data Protection

It is not possible to tag a file as belonging to multiple identities. Apps that must store data belonging to different users in the same file can do so manually, using the features provided by `MAMDataProtectionManager`. This allows the app to encrypt data and tie it to a particular user. The encrypted data is suitable for storing to disk in a file. You can query the data associated with the identity and the data can be unecrypted later.

Apps which make use of `MAMDataProtectionManager` should implement a receiver for the
`MANAGEMENT_REMOVED` notification. After this notification completes, buffers
which were protected via this class will no longer be readable if file encryption was
enabled when the buffers were protected. An app can remediate this situation by calling
MAMDataProtectionManager.unprotect on all buffers during this notification. Note that it
is also safe to call protect during this notification if it is desired to preserve identity
information -- encryption is guaranteed to be disabled during the notification.

public final class MAMDataProtectionManager {
    /**
     * Protect a stream. This will return a stream containing the protected

}
```

### Content Providers

If the app provides corporate data other than a **ParcelFileDescriptor** through a **ContentProvider**, the app must call the method `isProvideContentAllowed(String)` in `MAMContentProvider`, passing the owner identity's UPN (user principal name) for the content. If this function returns false, the content *must not* be returned to the caller. File descriptors returned through a content provider are handled automatically based on the file identity.

### Selective Wipe

If an app registers for the `WIPE_USER_DATA` notification, it will not receive the benefit of the SDK's default selective wipe behavior. For multi-identity aware apps, this loss may be more significant since MAM default selective wipe will wipe only files whose identity is targeted by a wipe.

If a multi-identity aware application wishes MAM default selective wipe to be done _**and**_ wishes to perform its own actions on wipe, it should register for `WIPE_USER_AUXILIARY_DATA` notifications. This notification will be sent immediately by the SDK before it performs the MAM default selective wipe. An app should never register for both WIPE_USER_DATA and WIPE_USER_AUXILIARY_DATA.

## Enabling MAM targeted configuration for your Android applications (optional)
Application-specific key-value pairs may be configured in the Intune
console. These key-value pairs are not interpreted by Intune at all,
but are simply passed on to the app. Applications which want to
receive such configuration can use the `MAMAppConfigManager` and
`MAMAppConfig` classes to do so. If multiple policies are targeted at
the same app, there may be multiple conflicting values available for
the same key.

### Example
```
MAMAppConfigManager configManager = MAMComponents.get(MAMAppConfigManager.class);
String identity = "user@contoso.com"
MAMAppConfig appConfig = configManager.getAppConfig(identity);
LOGGER.info("App Config Data = " + (appConfig == null ? "null" : appConfig.getFullData()));
String valueToUse = null;
if (appConfig.hasConflict("foo")) {
    List<String> values = appConfig.getAllStringsForKey("foo");
    for (String value : values) {
        if (isCorrectValue(value)) {
            valueToUse = value;
        }
    }
} else {
    valueToUse = appConfig.getStringForKey("foo", MAMAppConfig.StringQueryType.Any);
}
LOGGER.info("Found value " + valueToUse);
```

### Notification
App config adds a new notification type:
* **REFRESH_APP_CONFIG**: This notification is sent in a `MAMUserNotification` and informs the app that new app config data is available.

For more information about the capabilities of the Graph API with respect to the MAM targeted configuration values, see [Graph API Reference MAM Targeted Config](https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/docs/api-reference/beta/api/intune_mam_targetedmanagedappconfiguration_create). <br>


For more information about how to create a MAM targeted app configuration policy in Android, see the section on MAM targeted app config in [How to use Microsoft Intune app configuration policies for Android](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/app-configuration-policies-use-android).

## Style Customization (optional)

Views generated by the MAM SDK can be visually customized to more closely match the app in which it is integrated. You can customize primary, secondary, and background colors, as well as the size of the app logo. This style customization is optional and defaults will be used if no custom style is configured.


### How to customize
In order to have style changes apply to the Intune MAM views, you must first create a style override XML file. This file should be placed in the “/res/xml” directory of your app and you may name it whatever you like. Below is an example of the format this file needs to follow.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<styleOverrides>
    <item
        name="foreground_color"
        resource="@color/red"/>
    <item
        name="accent_color"
        resource="@color/blue"/>
    <item
        name="background_color"
        resource="@color/green"/>
    <item
        name="logo_image"
        resource="@drawable/app_logo"/>
</styleOverrides>
```

You must reuse resources that already exist within your app. For example, you must define the color green in the colors.xml file and reference it here. You cannot use the Hex color code “#0000ff." The maximum size for the app logo is 110 dip (dp). You may use a smaller logo image, but adhering to the maximum size will yield the best looking results. If you exceed the 110 dip limit, the image will scale down and possibly cause blurring.

Below is the complete list of allowed style attributes, the UI elements they control, their XML attribute item names, and the type of resource expected for each.

|Style attribute | UI elements affected | Attribute item name | Expected resource type |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Background color | PIN screen background color <Br>PIN box fill color | background_color | Color |
| Foreground color | Foreground text color <br> PIN box border in default state <br> Characters (including obfuscated characters) in PIN box when user enters a PIN| foreground_color | Color|
| Accent color | PIN box border when highlighted <br> Hyperlinks |accent_color | Color |
| App logo | Large icon that appears in the Intune app PIN screen | logo_image | Drawable |

## Limitations

### File Size limitations

For large code bases that run without [ProGuard](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/), the limitations of the Dalvik executable file format become an issue. Specifically, the following limitations may occur:

1.  The 65K limit on fields.
2.  The 65K limit on methods.

### Policy enforcement limitations

* **Screen Capture**: The SDK is unable to enforce a new screen capture setting value in Activities that have already gone through Activity.onCreate. This can result in a period of time where the app has been configured to disable screenshots but screenshots can still be taken.

* **Using Content Resolvers**: The "transfer or receive" Intune policy may block or partially block the use of a content resolver to access the content provider in another app. This will cause ContentResolver methods to return null or throw a failure value (e.g. `openOutputStream` will throw `FileNotFoundException` if blocked). The app can determine whether a failure to write data through a content resolver was caused by policy (or would be caused by policy) by making the call:
    ```java
    MAMPolicyManager.getPolicy(currentActivity).getIsSaveToLocationAllowed(contentURI);
    ```
    or if there is no associated activity

    ```java
    MAMPolicyManager.getPolicy().getIsSaveToLocationAllowed(contentURI);
    ```

    In this second case, multi-identity apps must take care to set the thread identity appropriately (or pass an explicit identity to the `getPolicy` call).

### Exported services

 The AndroidManifest.xml file included in the Intune App SDK contains **MAMNotificationReceiverService**, which must be an exported service to allow the Company Portal to send notifications to an enlightened app. The service checks the caller to ensure that only the Company Portal is allowed to send notifications.

### Reflection limitations
Some of the MAM base classes (e.g. MAMActivity, MAMDocumentsProvider)
contain methods (based on the original Android base classes) which use
parameter or return types only present above certain API levels. For
this reason, it may not always be possible to use reflection to
enumerate all methods of app components. This restriction is not
limited to MAM, it is the same restriction which would apply if the
app itself implemented these methods from the Android base classes.
## Expectations of the SDK consumer

The Intune SDK maintains the contract provided by the Android API, though failure conditions may be triggered more frequently as a result of policy enforcement. These Android best practices will reduce the likelihood of failure:

* Android SDK functions that may return null have a higher likelihood of being null now.  To minimize issues, ensure that null checks are in the right places.

* Features that can be checked for must be checked for through their MAM replacement APIs.

* Any derived functions must call through to their super class versions.

* Avoid use of any API in an ambiguous way. For example, using `Activity.startActivityForResult` without checking the requestCode will cause strange behavior.

## Telemetry

The Intune App SDK for Android does not control data collection from your app. The Company Portal application logs telemetry data by default. This data is sent to Microsoft Intune. As per Microsoft Policy, we do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII).

> [!NOTE]
> If end users choose not to send this data, they must turn off telemetry under Settings on the Company Portal app. To learn more, see [Turn off Microsoft usage data collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune-user-help/turn-off-microsoft-usage-data-collection-android). 

## Recommended Android best practices

* All library projects should share the same android:package where possible. This will not sporadically fail in run-time; this is purely a build-time problem. Newer versions of the Intune App SDK will remove some of the redundancy.

* Use the newest Android SDK build tools.

* Remove all unnecessary and unused libraries (e.g. android.support.v4)
