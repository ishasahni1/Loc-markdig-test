# Remove devices by using factory reset or remove company data

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

You can remove devices from Intune that are no longer needed, are being repurposed, or have gone missing. You can do this by issuing a **remove company data** or **factory reset** command. Users can also issue a remote command from the Intune Company Portal to personally owned devices enrolled in Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you remove a user from Azure Active Directory, issue a **Factory reset** or **Remove company data** command to all devices associated with that user. If you remove users with managed devices from Azure Active Directory, Intune can no longer issue factory reset or remove company data to those devices.

## Factory reset

**Factory reset** restores a device to its factory default settings, removing all company and user data and settings. The device is removed from Intune management. Factory reset is useful for resetting a device before giving it to a new user, or for instances where the device has been lost or stolen. Be careful about selecting factory reset. Data on the device cannot be recovered.

### To factory reset a device

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.
3. On the **Devices and groups** blade, choose **All devices**.
4. Choose the name of the device you want to factory reset.
5. On the blade showing the device's name, choose **Factory reset**
6. For Windows 10 version 1709 or higher, there is an additional option to "Retain enrollment state and user account". 
    
    |Retained through a factory reset|Not retained|
    | -------------|------------|
    |User accounts associated with the device|User files|
    |Machine state \(domain join, Azure Active Directory-joined)| User installed apps \(store and Win32 apps)|
    |MDM enrollment|Non-default device settings|
    |OEM installed apps \(store and Win32 apps)||
    |User profile||
    |User data outside of user profile||
    |User autologon|| 
    
         
7. Choose **Yes** to confirm the factory reset.

If the device is on and connected, it takes less than 15 minutes for a factory reset command to propagate across all device types.

## Remove company data

The **remove company data** command removes managed app data (where applicable), settings, and email profiles that were assigned by using Intune. Remove company data leaves the user's personal data on the device. The device is removed from Intune management. The following tables describe what data is removed, and the effect on data that remains on the device after company data is removed.

### To remove company data

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.
3. On the **Devices and groups** blade, choose **All devices**.
4. Choose the name of the device from which you want to remove company data.
5. On the blade showing the device's name, choose **Remove company data**, and then choose **Yes** to confirm.

If the device is on and connected, it takes less than 15 minutes for a remove data command to propagate across all device types.

## Delete devices from the Azure Active Directory portal

Due to communication issues or missing devices, you might need to delete devices from Azure Active Directory (AD). The delete command does not remove a device from management but you can use **Delete** to remove device records from the Azure portal that you know are unreachable and unlikely to communicate with Azure again.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Active Directory in the Azure portal](http://aka.ms/accessaad) with your admin credentials. You can also sign in to the [Office 365 portal](https://portal.office.com) and then choose **Admin** &gt; **Azure AD** from using the link on the left side of the page.
3.  Create an Azure subscription if you don’t have one. This should not require a credit card or payment if you have a paid account (choose the **Register your free Azure Active Directory** subscription link).
4.  Select **Active Directory** and then select your organization.
5.  Select the **Users** tab.
6.  Select the user whose devices you want to delete.
7.  Choose **Devices**.
8.  Remove devices as appropriate, such as those that are no longer in use, or those that have inaccurate definitions.
