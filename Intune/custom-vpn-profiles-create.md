# How to create custom VPN profiles in Microsoft Intune

## Create a custom configuration
You can use Intune custom configuration polices to create VPN profiles for:

* Devices that run Android 4 and later
* Enrolled devices that run Windows 8.1 and later
* Devices that run Windows Phone 8.1 and later
* Enrolled devices that run Windows 10 desktop 
* Devices that run Windows 10 Mobile

This type of policy can be useful when the standard Intune VPN policies do not contain the settings you want to use.

## To create a custom configuration policy:

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
2. Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.
3. On the **Intune** blade, choose **Device configuration**.
4. On the **Device Configuration** blade, choose **Manage** > **Profiles**.
5. On the profiles blade, choose **Create Profile**.
6. On the **Create Profile** blade, enter a **Name** and **Description** for the VPN profile.
7. From the **Platform** drop-down list, select the device platform to which you want to apply VPN settings. Currently, you can choose one of the following platforms for custom device settings:
	- **Android**
	- **iOS** (configured using a file you exported from Apple Configurator).
	- **macOS** (configured using a file you exported from Apple Configurator).
	- **Windows Phone 8.1**
	- **Windows 10 and later**
6. From the **Profile** type drop-down list, choose **Custom**.
7. On the **Custom OMA-URI Settings** blade, for each URI setting you want to specify, choose **Add**, provide the requested information, then choose **OK**. Here's an example:

   ![VPN profile custom configuration dialog box](./media/Intune_Add_VPN_URI.png)

4.  After you've entered all of URI settings you need, choose **OK**, and then, on the **Create Profile** blade, choose **Create**.

The profile will be created and appears on the profiles list blade.
If you want to go ahead and assign this profile to groups, see [How to assign device profiles](device-profile-assign.md).
