    - **Publisher** - Enter the name of the publisher of the app.

    - **Display this as a featured app in the Company Portal** - Display the app prominently on the main page of the company portal when users browse for apps.
    - **Information URL** - Optionally, enter the URL of a website that contains information about this app. The URL is displayed to users in the company portal.

    - **Notes** - Enter any notes you would like to associate with this app.
    - **Logo** - Upload an icon that is associated with the app. This icon is displayed with the app when users browse the company portal.
3. When you are finished, choose **OK**.

## Step 4 - Finish up

1. On the **Add app** blade, verify that you configured the information correctly.
2. Choose **Add**, to upload the app to Intune.
