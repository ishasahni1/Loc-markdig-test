# How to educate your end users about Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [both-portals](./includes/note-for-both-portals.md)]

Microsoft Intune helps you enable your workforce with mobile devices while keeping your corporate data protected. There are many steps to ensuring a successful deployment, including evaluating Intune through a [free trial](app-sdk.md).

None of these technologies will ensure that your users understand the importance of why you're managing their devices. In fact, many of your end users may feel as though you are infringing on their privacy - especially if you are deploying Intune as a [BYOD solution](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/byod-design-considerations-guide).

> [!Important]
> Understanding and proactively addressing your end users' concerns about why your company needs to manage devices is critical to a successful rollout.

Adoption is not just about getting the technology working and distributed throughout your workforce, but about getting your end user population to embrace the secured access that Intune provides them. Users may be intimidated of enterprise mobility because, by and large, we aren't explaining to them what they need to know about what enterprise mobility is for, and what it can (and can't) do.

## Things to consider about your end users

__What level of experience do your end users have?__ Your end users may have a range of experience with a variety of technology. These experiences could be both positive and negative, from memorable photos they've taken of their children, to that time they dropped their device into the sink and lost any data that wasn't backed up. These experiences color how they approach technology, and what perceptions they have of personal and business uses of devices.

__What does mobility management mean to me?__ Users may not have a full understanding of what access you do (and do not) have to their devices and their information. Users are likely to be concerned about the potential for IT and leadership to keep track of their every move. This can be especially worrying for less experienced users, who may believe that all activity on their devices is private. A more experienced user may have specific fears stemming from "big brother" spying on their devices, and may then evangelize their concerns to coworkers.

__How could this inconvenience my end users?__ It takes time to install apps, enroll devices, and maintain compliance. Ensuring your corporate data's security is the top priority of any Intune deployment, but requiring an unreasonable passcode on a personal device will cause your users to resent your management of their devices. Sending required app updates in the middle of business-critical conference calls could cause your users to become less productive, defeating the purpose of enabling them with mobile devices.

## Things you should do

Assuaging these user concerns will make your deployment smoother. We have a list of ways to consider to make it easier for your end users to embrace device management.

* __Be resourceful.__ The Intune documentation has a variety of content to help your end users figure out how to do certain tasks, like enrolling and troubleshooting their devices. Among these are articles that users are sent to from the Company Portal, which are divided into sections about Company Portal app installation and Intune enrollment, general tasks that users can do on their devices, and troubleshooting. This documentation can be found in our explanations of how to [use managed devices to get work done](/intune-user-help/use-managed-devices-to-get-work-done).

* __Be accessible.__ End users need to know where they can get help with their devices. Be sure that you include IT administrator contact information when you [customize the Company Portal](company-portal-customize.md) so that your users can get help if they need it.

* __Be personal.__ Providing instructions that aren't specific to your deployment can make end users feel like you haven't given any thought to their experience. You can use this [customizable, end user Intune enrollment template for IT administrators](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/office/Intune-End-User-Enrollment-3a0c9b0c) to create your own enrollment instructions for your end users.

* __Find different ways to communicate.__ As with [different learning styles](https://www.umassd.edu/dss/resources/facultystaff/howtoteachandaccommodate/howtoaccommodatedifferentlearningstyles/), users have preferred ways to consume information. For users that prefer video to documentation, we offer [video versions of how to enroll various device types](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/IntuneEnrollment) and more on Channel 9. These videos are available to embed directly into your own [SharePoint site](https://support.office.com/article/Embed-a-video-from-Office-365-Video-59e19984-c34e-4be8-889b-f6fa93910581) or for download of local copies - either of the video or just of the audio track.

* __Be aware.__ Your end user experience will impact your productivity, and understanding their experience will make it easier for you to troubleshoot their problems when they come to you. Understanding how end users get their apps can make it much easier for you to diagnose what issues they're experiencing, and can help you fix their problems faster.

* __Be forthcoming.__ Clearly tell your users what you're going to manage on their devices. Tell them what kind of data you're collecting and why you're collecting it. Inform them of how you're planning to use all asset data. [Microsoft believes that you have a right to as much information as possible about how we handle your customer data in the cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/about/transparency), and we believe that this philosophy can greatly increase your end user satisfaction with Intune.

>[!Note]
> Transparency, wherever possible, is fundamental to the success of your deployment.

You're trying to combine trust with well-crafted compliance policies to make sure that end users know that even if you *could* look at certain types of personal data, that you don't *want* to, and the liability that you could incur for invading their privacy. Crafting a statement with your legal and HR departments can help with particularly difficult employees.
