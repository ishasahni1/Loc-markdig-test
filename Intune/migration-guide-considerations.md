# Special migration considerations

There are special migration considerations which may apply depending on your existing MDM provider environment.

## Factory reset for Appleâ€™s Device Enrollment Program (DEP)

The Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP) sets device configurations that cannot be removed by the end user. To retain the advanced management features of DEP, the device must be returned to the out-of-box (new) state by a factory reset to enroll it into Intune.

To continue using DEP to manage the devices in Intune, [set up iOS device enrollment with Device Enrollment Program](device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md).
