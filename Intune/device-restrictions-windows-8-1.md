If you enable this setting for Windows 8.1 devices, all users of the device must have a Microsoft account.
For encryption to work, the device must meet the [Microsoft InstantGo](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2014/06/19/instantgo-a-better-way-to-sleep/#IBHULcTfI4PokO8X.97) hardware certification requirements.
When you enforce encryption on a device, the recovery key is only accessible from the user's Microsoft account, which is accessed from their OneDrive account. You cannot recover this key on behalf of a user.
