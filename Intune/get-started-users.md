# Get started with managing users

Think about all the different people in your organization. Every one of them that uses company data will need a user to manage access to it in Intune.

## How do I create a user?

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Using **Search resources**, search for **Intune**.
3. Once you've opened the **Microsoft Intune** blade, select **Users**. On the **All Users** page, select **+ New user**.
4. Enter details for the user, such as **Name** and **User name**. The domain name portion of the user name must either be the initial default domain name “contoso.onmicrosoft.com” domain name, or a verified, non-federated domain name such as “contoso.com.”
5. Under **Groups**, choose the test group to add the user to.
6. Save the automatically generated user password so that you can use it to log in to a test device. You must give this password to users so that they can change it to a normal password that they can remember.
7. On the **User** blade, select **Create**.

## Assigning licenses to users

After you've created a user, you need to use the [Office 365 portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=698854) to assign an Intune license to that user. Without assigning them a license, they can't enroll their device into management.

1. Sign in to the [Office 365 portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=698854) with the same credentials you used to sign in to Intune.
2. Select **Users** > **Active Users**, then select the user you previously created.
3. You may need to wait a moment for all of the user's information to load. Once it loads, select **Edit** for the user's **Product licenses**.
4. Assign the user a **Location**, then switch Intune to **on**.

 > [!NOTE]
 > This uses one of your licenses for this user. If you are using your live environment, you can turn off using this license later to reassign it to a real user.

5. Select **Save**.
