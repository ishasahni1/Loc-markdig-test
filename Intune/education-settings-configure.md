# How to configure Windows 10 education settings in Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Education profiles let you specify details that configure the Windows Take a Test app including account details, and the test URL. When you configure this, the Take a Test app opens with the test you specify, and no other apps can be run on the device until the test is complete.

For details about the Take a Test app, see [Take tests in Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/education/windows/take-tests-in-windows-10).

## Create a device profile containing education profile settings

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
2. Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.
3. On the **Intune** blade, choose **Device configuration**.
2. On the **Device Configuration** blade, choose **Manage** > **Profiles**.
3. On the profiles blade, choose **Create Profile**.
4. On the **Create Profile** blade, enter a **Name** and **Description** for the device restriction profile.
5. From the **Platform** drop-down list, select **Windows 10 and later**.
6. From the **Profile type** type drop-down list, choose **Education profile**. 
7. Choose Settings > Configure, then, on the **Take a Test** blade, configure the following:
    - **Account user name** - Enter the user name of the account used with Take a Test. This can be a domain account, an Azure Active Directory (AAD) account, or a local computer account.
    - **Assessment URL** - Provide the URL of the test you want users to take. For more information, see the Take a Test documentation.
    - **Screen monitoring** - Specify whether you want to be able to monitor screen activity while users are taking a test.
    - **Text suggestion** - Allow or block text suggestions while users are taking a test.
8. When you're done, go back to the **Create Profile** blade, and hit **Create**.

The profile will be created and appears on the profiles list blade.

## Next steps

If you want to go ahead and assign this profile to groups, see [How to assign device profiles](device-profile-assign.md).
