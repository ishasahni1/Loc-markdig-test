# How to create a device compliance policy to enable Google Play Protect

You can create a new compliance policy for the Android platform to check for Google Play Protect (GPP) compliance.

The compliance policy that requires these settings can then be targeted to a group of Android users or devices. If a device does not have these settings enabled, it falls out of compliance.

## Create a compliance policy

1. Sign in to the Azure portal. Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** + **Intune**.
2. Choose **Device compliance** in the **Manage** group. 
3. Choose **Policies**, and choose **Create Policy**.
4. Type the policy **Name** and **Description**.
5. Select **Android** for the Platform.
6. Choose **Settings** > **Device Health**.
7. Configure the **Google Play Protect** settings.
8. When you have set the Google Play Protect settings, specify the **Security** and **Device property** settings. When you are done, choose **OK**.

## Configure the Google Play Protect settings

 - **Google Play Services is configured**  
   Require that the Google Play services app is installed and enabled. Google Play services allows security updates and is a base-level dependency for many security features on certified-Google devices.
 - **Up-to-date security provider**  
   Require that an up-to-date security provider can protect a device from known vulnerabilities.
 - **Threat scan on apps**  
   Require that the Android **Verify Apps** feature is enabled.
    > [!Note]  
    > On the legacy Android platform, this feature is a compliance setting. Intune can only check whether this setting is enabled at the device level. On devices with work profiles, formerly Android for Work, this setting can be found as a configuration policy setting. This allows administrators to enable the setting for a device.

    If your enterprise uses Android work profiles, you can enabled **Threat scan on apps** for your enrolled devices. Establish a device profile and require the system security setting. For more information, see [Android for Work device restriction settings in Microsoft Intune](device-restrictions-android-for-work.md).

 - **SafetyNet device attestation**  
   Set the level of SafetyNet device attestation integrity that must be met. Levels include **Not configured**, **Check basic integrity**, and **Check basic integrity & certified devices**.
