# How to manage apps you purchased from the Microsoft Store for Business with Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

The [Microsoft Store for Business](https://www.microsoft.com/business-store) gives you a place to find and purchase apps for your organization, individually, or in volume. By connecting the store to Microsoft Intune, you can manage volume-purchased apps from the Azure portal. For example:
* You can synchronize the list of apps you have purchased from the store with Intune.
* Apps that are synchronized appear in the Intune administration console; you can assign these apps like any other apps.
* You can track how many licenses are available, and how many are being used in the Intune administration console.
* Intune blocks assignment and installation of apps if there are an insufficient number of licenses available.
* Apps managed by Windows Store for Business will automatically revoke licenses when a user leaves the enterprise, or when the administrator removes the user and the user devices.

## Before you start

Review the following information before you start syncing and assigning apps from the Microsoft Store for Business:

- Configure Intune as the mobile device management authority for your organization.
- You must have signed up for an account on the Microsoft Store for Business.
- Once you have associated a Windows Business Store account with Intune, you cannot change to a different account in the future.
- Apps purchased from the store cannot be manually added to or deleted from Intune. They can only be synchronized with the Microsoft Store for Business.
- Intune synchronizes both online and offline licensed apps you have purchased from the Microsoft Store for Business.
- Only offline apps that are free of charge can be synced to Intune.
- To use this capability, devices must be joined to Active Directory Domain Services, or workplace-joined.
- Enrolled devices must be using the 1511 release of Windows 10 or later.

## Associate your Microsoft Store for Business account with Intune
Before you enable synchronization in the Intune console, you must configure your store account to use Intune as a management tool:
1. Ensure that you sign into the Business Store using the same tenant account you use to sign into Intune.
2. In the Business Store, choose **Settings** > **Management tools**.
3. On the Management tools page, choose **Add a management tool**, and choose **Microsoft Intune**.

> [!NOTE]
> You could previously only associate one management tool to assign apps with the Microsoft Store for Business. You can now associate multiple management tools with the store, for example, Intune and Configuration Manager.

You can now continue, and set up synchronization in the Intune console.

## Configure synchronization

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
2. Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.
3. On the **Intune** blade, choose **Mobile apps**.
1. On the **Mobile Apps** blade, choose **Setup** > **Microsoft Store for Business**.
2. Click **Enable**.
3. If you haven't already done so, click the link to sign up for the Microsoft Store for Business and associate your account as detailed previously.
5. From the **Language** drop-down list, choose the language in which apps from the Microsoft Store for Business is displayed in the Azure portal. Regardless of the language in which they are displayed, they are installed in the end user's language when available.
6. Click **Sync** to get the apps you've purchased from the Microsoft Store into Intune.

## Synchronize apps

1. In the **Mobile apps** workload, choose **Setup** > **Microsoft Store for Business**.
2. Click **Sync** to get the apps you've purchased from the Microsoft Store into Intune.

## Assign apps

You assign apps from the store in the same way you assign any other Intune app. For more information, see [How to assign apps to groups with Microsoft Intune](apps-deploy.md). However, instead of assigning apps from the **All Apps** page, you assign them from the **Licensed Apps** page.

Offline apps can be targeted to user groups, device groups, or groups with users and devices.
Offline apps can be installed for a specific user on a device or for all users on a device. 


When you assign a Microsoft Store for Business app, a license is used by each user who installs the app. If you use all of the available licenses for an assigned app, you cannot assign any more copies. Take one of the following actions:
* Uninstall the app from some devices.
* Reduce the scope of the current assignment, targeting only the users you have sufficient licenses for.
* Buy more copies of the app from the Microsoft Store for Business.
